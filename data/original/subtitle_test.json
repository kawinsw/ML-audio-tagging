terms of what the biggest drivershey what's happening right now as we got through NAFTA 2.0 and made an assumption we would immediately turn to China start negotiating that and that's not happeningChina and that is really going to show up in a really big items there a real economic Warand Rising interest rates you say Nancy at the market is recalibrating right now how are you recalibrating your Holdingsattractive valuations that we're taking a look at we've been adding to some of the consumer discretionary name is Amazon so Home Depot in McDonald's those are both stocks that areonly correlated to rising and Rising Energy prices so that's positive for the consumer you kind of would think the opposite but in fact thatstocks at higher end and they just aren't very consistent about as his Home Depot so we're finding places to go but but we're cautious I meanhunting seasons going to be tricky recalibrating what your advising or doingwe think that one of the most dangerous things that's happening right now is you saying this move to defensive so over the last week or so you've seen the Reeds and Utilities in the Staples actually catch a bit and then right here sitting by methe wrong thing to do I think if you want to get defensive you want to move to cash I think getting into those even if valuations were at now is getting ahead of yourself and those who the reverse quite quickly when you don't have thatnatural flow out-of-market that's that's a date investigators part of the trade I think where we see the most value currently I think it's a combination of healthcare for sure energywe certainly think you can start thinking about technology witches as probably the worst before we will be soon over the last monthwhat's under the hood in the market we already saw Healthcare the best performing stock in the third quarter we say Fang stocks already in correction territory we saw the semiconductors OhioMichael telleria the markets in correction territory the average small cap stock according to bespoke is down 20%I mean I think this is this what we're all trying to figure out because you got a fed that's pushing forward with it to fight inflation The elusive inflationa list of for Janet Yellen and then he's got a market that is growing but we're not sure how fast and what are the input the price the price inputs are going to be an impacta strong dollar which is going to hurt the multinational so what we're trying to figure out on a company by company basis is who has the growth and we are overweight in Old Tech Healthand and somebody Industrials have done quite well like Boeing and we see some of that continuing some of the areas of concern thetrade Cold War at the concerns over slowing growth in China inflation oil prices spiking 10-year yield strong US dollar Emerging Market weaknessall of those factors how can you be bullish on the marketI think everything else to a certain extent is going to be transitory for sure the dollar will not continue to be strong forever when we're not the only Central Bank that is normalizing when the ECB thatand start to normalize first quarter of next year fourth quarter of this year when you see some let's break when we stop acting so tough on trade we're really in the sausage-making part of this trade right now it feels likewhen is the 2018 but when we negotiate we don't want to be in a long drag mutually destructive trade Warwe also want to act tough and get China to change some Behavior but right now watching that happen is like trying to learn how to parallel park in a demolition derby it's just not funcausing anxiety in the marketplace so final question to both of you are going to start next week basically what are you looking for and I guess my question is whatmore important the the rear word looking numbers or what these companies say prospectivelyyou want to hear I want to hear that the top the top line is still growing and they expect to see the top on Grindr I am less concerned about earnings in the near short-term then I am about Top Line growththat's what I'm going to be paying attentionand bring down your guidance going forward I think II

this place has some amazingtechnology you've seen by the way this place is all brand new so you've seen that's right you know what these are the luggage cart will this pretty much steps it up a thousand notchesrobots that take your luggage to your room robots that lead you around the hotel and robots that can deliver room service and maybe in the past you've seen those little roomsrobots that are kind of small they might fit like a bottle of soda in there no these are amazing got to check them out so the first robot here at the hotel is this as hell the wayfinder so you'llit's at the entrance of the hotel you say where you want to go let's go to the new steakhouse can I take you there now yes so this robot will leave me toolake house and you can see this a pretty sizable robot so it says please stand clear 5 feet in front of me while I'm moving so someone was to get in front of this robeit will definitely stop now here's the really cool part about this robot because you're following it not only is it going to take you to the steakhouse it's also go over here since I know herit's also going to open these doors wirelessly so here we go let's see if it sends a signal to the doors later that so not onlylead me to the steakhouse thanks robot now I can go right in and place looks pretty good so I'll have to check that out later let me show you therobot over here this one is going to deliver food to your room it's walk over the long walk see that's whatalright so Fred is going to open up this one this is a room service robot so you don't normally have someone come to your room bring you the food will this one watch thisside you've got spaces for your food and you just pull your food out when it'll call your room and it gets there pull your food out bring it into your room you can leave a tip insideI don't know maybe the robot will take it and then you close it up and it will be on his merry way thanks friend right now these are at least robots are called chugand of course your first instinct when you see one is two step right on it and take a ride and guess what that's why they have this sign right here although it can support you you're notstand on the thing and the robots are sleeping there just recharging right there so we'll find their way around by you know by themselveshere's the coolest robot so this is the third type of robot that use here and this one is the luggage robot so here you go rightyou got what looks like a luggage cart is kind of reconfigure to sit on that tug robot and we open the door you can put your luggage inside right there can fit a bunch ofcases it's all secure so you can see you've got the lock on the outside and when it comes to your room it will actually ring your phone tell you that the deliveries thereit'll give you a four-digit codes that you can unlock this yourself so if anyone finds this in the hotel wild making your way making its way up to your room you're not going to open it so that's niceand of course if you happen to get locked inside which you shouldn't cuz you should be fooling around inside you can open it up from the inside nowsome parents are going requested their kids get taken up to the room inside this you cannot do that that is not an approved method for these robots yet although if I was suggesting that I take himlike up every single floor and now the robot you can see they have this cool they gave it like a personality and if you notice it doeshave a name just yet so the Sheraton is going to do a contest to name this so keep an eye out in the comments I'll put the link if you want to and I'll maybe win something by naming this guy and allsensors are in here as well so let's fire him up and we got we got several robots passing here it's likeAirport runway so this guy is stopping and you can see when they come through they go really slow because he's our heavy machinery you don't want to get in front of thembut if you do I'll say what happens doesn't it just feel high tech in here with these robots me that's part of the fun of seeing this up yeah let's let's fire him up so now once youyour luggage in there the front desk will key in your room number and it will make its way up all by itself so let's let's follow this guytry this at home but I'm going to step in front of the robot and see what happens okay so here we go thank you for stoppingso let him get on his way and you can see once you get in front of him he's very cautious about his next move because these are very friendly robotsSears a lot of people moving so they have to be very they got to be on their game with Those sensors so here's what he does he makes his way over hereregular guest elevators this robot is going to take a secondary Bank of elevators that are around the corner here so hego that way and here's what the best part about these robots are the service people up front you know that the Bellman all those people they will still walk YouTubebut now they've the freedom to interact with you and chat with you while this guy is doing all the heavy lifting and all the hard work so less waiting for them and you know you still get that human interactI think this is really cool this is the first hotel in the nation to have these robots and so of course when people come to the hotel that's like ait's like an add-on you get to take pictures with this thing I'm sure people post up maybe I'll take a selfie with him real quick and just remind heretake a selfie okay and you see he's open the door so he's got work to do thanks so much for watching if you like this video go ahead and give it 2 Thumbs Uplearn something from it share it with your friends on Facebook I love and you guys watch these videos and comment on them have any questions I'll try to

from their reputation as a as a reputable supplier of oildo you know all the different markets so I think from here what we have to focus on is the potential for there to be a break-even price that's arguably higher than the 80.as per barrel did Mohammed bin Salman and other senior government officials have been targeting for the last several months and Bloomberg itself reported back in April that thereyour comfortability with a higher price also now we have to wonder whether they're going to be comfortable with $90 are they going to test that hire range that's the keybe wondering about because it's clear that with foreign investment pulling out with higher cost of of operations and higher costs of supplyingthat's that's the that's the problem relationship comes into play because if they have to buy weapons from another country that could cost more if they have less forcoming into this into Saudi Arabia are going to need that oil money and that's a very different circumstance 6 months ago or more like I don't know if they like it they like 90and I think the other thing we have to be cognizant of his as we move into this timeframe where there's a lot of potential for further Supply disruptions in Iran and then in Venezuelaare we going to see them actually raise output next summer you know there is always an increase in the amount of oil that's used in MassI'm so will they raise output up to 10 and a half million Barrel today or will they just keep it at 10 million barrels a day flat if they keep it in that lower range then we're going to end upstock Joslin next summer at the very same time that Iranian Supply is lower and Venezuelan supplies lower as wellwhen it comes to a Ron so I think we've seen over the course of the last six months is it kind of evolution in terms of the policy of this Administration it's clear that at the at the outit was we're going to zero no no exceptions in a secretary mnuchin was was over in in Europe over the over the weekend and then in the Middle Eastchicken saying yeah we are going to go to zero again so I think it remains an open question but it's clear that they need to at least issue some significantsuction exemptions for India for China as they notice or test this higher range72 we also heard some things from Summer J on Friday talking about execution issues in the Permianso can we take a very fundamental do to the to how we look at the oil markets and we see as we look into next year so that the supply and demand balance looking back into Surplusgiven that Outlook we cannot be other more bullish view than we are right now and we expect that we will see stock starting to build againand arguably we could even see it as soon as the next quarter so given that Outlook we continue to be of the view that prices need to stay in the rain between 70 and 75however we see we see A disruption scenario that is more aggressive than what we are currently assuming and by the way the bull we are assuming is quite aggressive alrightis Venezuela below 800,000 barrels a day it's another three to four hundred thousand barrels a day lower for Iran its you know A disruption assumed for Nigeria in the furorder so all of this we

welcome back to Good Morning America do you see some chili new video out this morning from Paris peopleout of that theater the bataclan theater where there had been a hostage situation one of six site attack in the heart of the French capitalat least 127 people killed Brooklyn hearing that hundred more wounded in the second major terror attack inside Paris this year Isisclaimed responsibility at this morning we're learning that a Syrian passport was found on one of the 8th Terrace and George's the third major attack that Isis claimed responsibilityI just missed the last couple of weeks in the French president or lawn this morning declaring war on Isis is George Stephanopoulos here with Paula Faris / special editionGood Morning America Paris under attack and all of this is an entire country right now in state of emergencyone of those attacks in Paris good morning Matt Americans were in factand at least one of these attacks were not sure where it could possibly be in that theater behind me that was packed with up to 1,500 people when those terrorists stormed it that wayof a group of eight suicide attackers essentially wearing suicide vest arms with AK-47s and grenade attacking 6 separate locations andperfectly coordinated attack one was near the stadium of France the other was in a very very busy restaurant District attacking people just having dinner and of course the other was right here at thethe band Eagles of Death Metal was having a concert people taken hostage there at least 80 dead in that site rightI mean what up riffic thing it must have been there still dried blood in the streets around memorials here a makeshift hospital to set up right behind mehundreds and thousands of people were lower down from the second floor and French authorities are still trying to find those responsible saying that there are likelytopless is out there somehow they have mobilized 1,500 additional troops Fanning out across the city and the country and for the first time in years here inwe're told that curfews might actually be happening French people told to stay off the streets as much as possible right now Georgecorresponding brand rice and bread we just heard Matt say the search for accomplices right now the French police believe they got all eight attackers this could have been a huge Network absolutely believe it was a hugeplans on the outside but carried out inside France with people who are likely French as some conclusion already reached by the French president he's saying this was planoutside it is Isis and he's declaring war exactly squarely fingering Isis as responsible and Isis in the last few hours as issued statement of responsibilityArabic and French in Russian and in English their social media propaganda is going. We would imagine they would do that even if they didn't direct this attackcase they have specific for they say were part of their operation they identified eight people 8 brothers and they talk about the targets they chose the game of the soccer game because it was their enemiesFrance and Germany and The Rock concert they call that a party of perversity that's why it was chosen and they say this is only the beginning of the stormgetting is Paula just said we've now seeing this is now the third attack in just the last couple of weeks that's right the alleged bombing of the Russian jetliner in Egypt the bombing in Beirut and now thiswhich case Isis claimed responsibility okay Brian Ross thanks very much  ", "sDNe6RiV1Tk": "it was reported today that the Trump Administration will be revoking obama-era legal guidelines in which the federal governmentPurchase College to use race as a factor in admissions is if they needed encouragement if that's the case it'll be a long-awaited blow in favor of a koalain civil rights and standards in American Life in more and more parts of our life in this country critical decisions are being made simply on people's appearance onAce or gender instead of an actual measures of achievement or Maritime that's terrifying obviously one of the places where Merit is most critical is in medicine We Trust positions to make a ydeath decisions they do everyday confidence is critical there obviously but medical schools don't see it that way when applying to medical schoolcritical factors are an applicant's GPA and the score on the Medical College admissions test the MCATand a high MCAT score you want that for your doctor but the standards is not the same for everybody it differs by appearance for example applicants with an MCAT of29 in GPA of 3.4 to 3.5 9 if you have those numbers and you're Asian you have a 21% chance of getting into a medical schoolif you're white you have a 29% chance of getting in with those numbers but if you're Hispanic you have a 60% chance of getting in African-American applicants1% acceptance rate with those numbers letter words with an identical scores an African-American applicant was four times as likely to be admitted as an Asianbecause of appearance Vijay chokalingam knows more than most people at the dark underbelly medical school admissions he is of Indian Heritage but he wanted to go to medicso he shaved his head and started going by his middle name which is JoJo he presented himself as African-American he says it made all the difference and got him into medical schoolhe has written a book on this experience called Almost black we spoke to him recently he was part of the conversation thank you very muchTonight Show you are convinced based on your experience that your race or what the medical school perceived your racecritical in getting in so exactly like you mentioned I reviewed the statistical data published by the American Association medical collegesdoubt that I was much more likely to get into admission as an African-American as an Asian-American so I came up with that scam that you described earlier I managed tointo Washington University and I'm sorry get waitlisted at Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania which are the third and fourth best medical schools in the country at the timeand I managed to get into St Louis University School of Medicine despite the fact that my 3.1 GPA was dramatically lower than their average of 3 pointsso my plan paid off much more than I expected what does it say about the people whoApple schools that they'd be willing to lower standards for Physicians many of whom you know wheels scalpels for a livingsome abstract diversity goal that seems Reckless so as a result of this systemessentially allows students who are not as qualified as others to get in now I don't want to talk about the end product weather this results inPhysicians who are of lower quality but I will say that it is a system of legalized racism the universities are promoting and medical schools are fromdiscrimination against asian-americans on a massive scale and it also promotes negative stereotypes about the competencyprofessionalism of African-American Physicians and Healthcare professionals important to realize that there was a university ofIllinois Urbana-Champaign study which showed that affirmative action actually promoted negative stereotypes about African-Americans and Hispanicsoriginal reason of course it is is there some reason that we should care about what our doctors look like his appearancepracticing medicine so I never graduated medical school so I can't say that it but ultimatelywe want to live in a society where you judge someone based on mirror are you erase should not be relevant to your ability to practice medicineeffectively and that's not the type of society would you want to promote necessarily yeslisten for this I think your hero for doing it and I would love to

terriblyimportant role not just bringingdemocracy but a sense ofsensibilities and internationallaw and --trish: i will stop you.i don't buy it.i don't want to go down thewhole road like we went downwith iraq.i don't think it is necessarilyabout that.i think if we were actuallyabout that, robert, we would bemore active in africa or not.isn't this ultimately about oil?i once spoke to an oil analyst,it is all about oil and there isnoing wrong with saying that,and nothing wrong with actuallyhaving it.we pretend it is all about thedemocracy but it is all aboutthe control of oil?&gt;&gt; actually i don't agree withthat.i think in the grand scheme ofthings america has an interestin having a moral order builtaround self-determination and atthe end of the day while we cannot afford to bring that toeveryone we can at least modelit.oil is part of the economy.trish: why bring to one placeand not another?&gt;&gt; you get into very bigdiscussion topic why we wentinto iraq.i personally think we shouldhave stayed in afghanistan,gotten that job done before wetried anything else.trish: this president ran on theplatform that we were not goingto be out there meddling ineverybody's

inwell there's there's evidence on both sides there is evidence that all things being equal Asian Americans tend to need higher satACT scores or higher gpas to get in to very selective colleges but there they also hireeducational credentials then white students so the idea that any displacement of asian-americans is because of affirmative actionI would argue that's not yet proven but there's something going on and they're competing theories about what's going on so you saidthere is some evidence that schools hold Asian applicants to higher standards average to look at the SATstores that are available are the averages say for elite colleges you will see Asian Americans needing seeming to needhigher SAT scores higher gpas to get in then then white students in addition to than other

increased wages and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollarsit will do this by changing the way the United States issues green cards to Nationals from other countries green cards provide permanentfancy work authorization and fast-track to citizenship for decades United States was operated and has operated a very lowskilled immigration system issuing record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants this policy is play substantialAmerican workers taxpayers and Community Resources among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and very importantly minority workcompeting for jobs against brand new arrival and it has not been fair to our people to our citizens to our workerschain migration and replaces are low-skilled system with a new points-based system for receiving a green cardthis competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English financially support themselves and their familiesand demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy the raise act prevents do migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfareand protect you as workers from being displaced and that's a very big thing then I'm going to come in and just immediately go and collectthat doesn't happen under the raise act they can't do that crucially the Green Card reforms in the raise act will give American workers a pay raiseby reducing unskilled immigration this legislation will not only restore a Competitive Edge in the 21st century but it will restore the seabonds of trust between America and its citizens this legislation demonstrates our

skilled immigrants you can come hereyour entrepreneurial spirit and their Innovative capabilities and make a higher wage create new jobs rather Americans and new immigrants speak Englishand contribute to our economy and stand on their own two feet and pay taxes and not receive welfare and not drive down wages for working class Americansthe raise act will change all of that by reorienting are green

very well and secondly I think is really Consolidated Republican support in the wake of that fight over Supreme Court Justice Debra cabin I think that's really helped himunify Republicans by and get them excited again so we have seen enough to have 41% still not great it still in a danger zone for president's going into midterm most presidents have a poolis that local in the midterms lose seats in the midterm elections but it is on the rise and that's helpat gender women are more disapproving of the president they prefer Democratic house candidates and overall there seems to be more of a sense of urgency about this midterm with womendividing that and how critical do you think the female vote is this gender gap is as high as we've ever seen him pulling been pulling the gender get going back to 1982 it's nevertie going into midterm electioncharacter temperament the way he goes about his business and of course the me-too movement is fueling it as well we've seen it to tremendous rise

newest technology is even more advanced\nthan you know.the official name for the remote controlled\n\"drones\" we know and love/hate is uavs orunmanned aerial vehicles, though the military\ncalls them unmanned aerial systems or uass.the word \"drone\" implies something which operates\non its own, though most military drones oruavs are simply remote controlled -- but for\nthe sake of simplicity we'll call them dronesanyway\u2026the first weaponized drone was flown in 1994\n-- the predator mq-1; but advances in thelast 20 years have been incredible.take, for example, the largest drone around\ntoday: a 757-sized uav called triton operatedby the u.s. navy.its 130-foot wingspan and fuel efficiency\nallows it to fly 2,000 nautical miles in amission, identify ships, de-ice its wings,\nand navigate turbulence -- all without humaninteraction.the thing can even be struck by lightning\nand still operate.most flying drones operate for 20 hours and\nare pre-programmed to fly to a specific areaand look around, or piloted to a mission by\na person in a ground station.the military controls these giant aircraft\nfrom hundreds of miles away via satellitecommunications, gps and the aircraft's onboard\ncomputers.this combination of ground and space-based\nsystems can affect how long information takesto get to the pilot -- predators took a long\nas five minutes to get detailed information,making the uav system extra important, but\ntoday, the newest drones can provide 360 degreevideo, infrared, and radar data: all live.most uass include line-of-site control for\ntake-off and landing, and satellite controlduring long flights and missions which would\ngo out of range of a tower or antenna.obviously direct control is faster, satellites\nhave a 1-second delay... but if somehow thesignal is lost from the human pilot, the drone\ncan be programmed to fly in circles, or returnto its take-off point.it can even land on its own if it has to.drones aren't only airborne.the drone boat is a true autonomous and artificially\nintelligent helper boat.these drone boats are programmed to swarm\ntargets without human instruction -- theycan network with each other, and though they're\nunarmed, are supposed to isolate a craft orintercept enemy fire without putting people\nin harms way.another naval drone uses biomimicry technology\nto look like sharks or fish!these drones can operate in 10 inches of water\nor dive to 300 feet either tethered to a ship,or autonomously; only surfacing to communicate.they're unarmed, but key for intelligence\ngathering.the future of drones is getting crazy.virtual reality is coming, where pilots can\n\"look\" through cameras and pilot aircraftor boats like a video game.it's already come to commercial drones used\nfor star wars pod-racing-style games.but the u.s. air force is pulling out all\nthe stops with their \"secret\" space shuttle.the x-37b launched in 2012 and orbited the\nearth for 500 days autonomously, returningand landing on its own in 2014.no one knows what it's for\u2026 but it's technically\na drone.and people allegedly spotted northrop-grumman's\nflying wings over texas, a type of aircraftrumored for a long while, even tested by nasa,\nbut still classified, if it exists at all.drones have advanced so much in 20 years\u2026\nwill another 20 have them delivering pizzas,filming football games, going to asteroids\nand flying us around the globe.who knows, but one things for sure, they're\nhere to stay.there is something that could dampen drones\nin our time, if the people put their footdown and stop their use in the military, but\nit doesn't seem like that's going to happen.for more check out testtube for the pros and\ncons of drones in war here.that being said, drones are

around the world growth is acceleratingaccelerating in many parts certainly in the US grow too strong unemployment is very low cost-push inflation is coming in I think that creates pressure too long

therethis is when you and your family need to get to your safe place to ride out the stormwow take a look at this storm. it's incredible. great looking structure here guyswe've got rotation going on at the base here. alright a lowering of that basewe call this a supercell by the way a rotating thunderstorm is a supercell not all of them produced tornadoesbut this one's got a chance. we're watching this base. it's lowering almost looks like there's a funnelstarting to appear from the wall cloud. yes. there it is. do we have debris on the ground? yes, we dothere's a debris cloud a connectionnow you have a tornado on the ground a tornado on the ground at this time when tornadoes form they're not usually that wideokay, just like this one, but it's important to point out that size doesn't always equate to the intensity todaythere's a mobile doppler radar actually feeding back real-time wind speeds, you knowand i'm being told that those wind speeds are approaching about 85 miles per hourso that's likely going to be an ef-0. all rightef-0 damage here is tree branches thrown around some roof shingles peel back, but hold on. let's look at this tornadoit's going for more of a rope now to a much thicker tone a much wider 22 looks more like a stovepipe nowit's called stovepipe because it resembles one this can produce ef-1 damage potentiallyall right, 86 to 110 mile-per-hour winds here.  mobile homes now can be flipped or rolled roof severely damaged hereand there can be extensive power outages...[power line falls over]jeez that was closelook at when you got a tornado like this power lines are gonna fall sometimes like dominoes just like you see hereyou've got to stay clear of these even if they don't appear to be livethey're still extremely dangerous the ground may be energized around the poleall right stand at least 40 feet away and frankly if you're standing where i am, you're way too close; way too closeall right, that was intense. let's keep looking at this tornado because it's still moving toward us and from what i'm hearingfrom the doppler on wheels. it is still intensifying they're giving winds now 111 to 135 miles per hourso this is likely an ef-2all rightif they can find the damage that equal today that is equal to thatwinds are now strong enough to not just roll a mobile homebut completely destroy it tear off complete rooms and send debris through the air like missiles. [2 by 4 breaks window]geez! how are you gonna get out of the way of that thing?this is exactly why we need you away from all the exterior wallsbecause debris flying through the air like that leads to so many injuries and deaths and tornadoeswe're still under a tornado warning. the twister is now more than likely producing ef-3 damagedoppler winds exceed a 150 miles per hourthis tornado is capable of severely damaging large structures and destroyingwell-constructed homes like this one that we brought into the studio roofs gonethe only thing left in this house are a few interior roomsall right, the safest place in this house is the central bathroomthis is the lowest level that you should be in if you don't have a shelter that is below groundput as many walls between you and the outside that you can and remember when you go to take cover grab a helmet grab asturdy pair of shoes because you have to walk outside after the tornado and that presents all kinds of new hazardsclearly an ef-3 is life-threatening. thankfully that less than 1% of all tornadoesin the us are classified higher the problem is that's exactly what we're seeing herethe mobile doppler radar now detecting winds in excess of 180 miles per hour that is likely ef-4 damagei mean look at the funnelyou can't even see it from edge to edge this type of tornado is pulverizing everything in its pathhuge heavy objects thrown into the air and carried several hundred feet[car falls to ground]geez you got to be kidding melook at this this beat-up3000 pound car it was lofted by the tornado and tossed around with that piece of wood that we saw earlierit could have come from a mile awaymangled. we got gasoline leaking outthat's even creating more hazards, you knowit's not unusual for tornadoes to displace large objects in the pasta bus was carried a half a mile a mattress some 40 miles and paperlofted and carrying over200 miles from its original starting placesurely this tornado is lofting objects up and centrifuge in the mouth. it means business and believe it or not. it is actually getting strongerthis thing is this is called a wedge tornado it is wider than it is tall theytwo miles acrossimagine that thing coming at you with 200 mile-per-hour winds. this is a deadly ef5. lights?yeah, they're starting to flicker now. we're about to get hit. this is as bad as it getsi'm grabbing my helmet and

you are at the farthest distance on the first floor from the outside walkswhat's going on there?those big objects. maybe the roof is being torn off. we don't know, but i've got a helmet but that

"i_w3v6t3rjY": "relations between saudi arabia and iran, following\nthe saudi execution of a shia cleric, areworse than ever before.meanwhile, the war in syria, and the israel-palestine\nconflict show few signs of ending.in the middle of all this unrest is the tiny\ncountry of lebanon.the culturally and religiously diverse nation\nhas been caught in a huge tug-of-war betweenneighboring warfare and discord.so, what\u2019s going on?and why is lebanon in the middle?well, since the 1970s, lebanon has been in\na state of political turmoil.out of 18 different religious sects, the majority\nare sunni and shia muslims, with a similarlylarge christian population.even the country\u2019s constitution delegates\nthe proportions of christians and muslimsin government.numerous groups have been fighting for power\nfollowing the 1975 to 1990 lebanese civilwar, which killed more than 150,000 people\nand disrupted any functional government.one such shee-ah group is hezbollah, considered\nby the us and other countries to be a terroristorganization.the group is part of an ongoing conflict with\nisrael - stemming from the 1982 lebanon war.they were originally funded by iran to lead\na shiite resistance in lebanon.as such, hezbollah has decried saudi arabia\u2019s\nrecent execution of a shia cleric.hezbollah has considerable power in both the\ncabinet and parliament, where they hold twelveseats as the loyalty to the resistance bloc.on the other side, saudi arabia is supported\nby sunni groups.many sunnis believe that iran is seeking disproportionate\ncontrol over lebanon.the majority of the muslim world is, in fact,\nsunni.many lebanese sunnis are also fighting in\nneighboring syria against the assad regime.and while the sunni-shia divide is at the\nheart of multiple middle eastern conflicts,lebanon also has a sizeable christian population\nin the mix.during the lebanese civil war, the syrian\narmy invaded lebanon, ostensibly to protectchristians and establish peace.however, it took until 2005, 15 years after\nthe end of the war, for them to finally withdrawfrom lebanon, leaving considerable distrust\ntowards syria by all three groups.since 2009 the seven major political groups\nhave been in deadlock in their attempts toform a cohesive government.most recently, elections which were supposed\nto occur in 2014 were pushed to 2017, withthe parliament citing security fears.and, the country has not had a president in\nover a year.effectively, the country\u2019s ongoing crises\nhave become deeply entangled in the surroundingregion\u2019s conflicts.and because the lebanese government is comprised\nof a number of fractured religious and ethnicgroups it has been almost impossible to elect\na single, unified leader.despite multiple attempts at a unity government,\nthere is still considerable infighting.on top of all that, more than one million\nsyrian refugees have entered the country,alongside an existing nearly half a million\npalestinian refugees.and attacks by isis have further destabilized\nthe already conflicted government.in the end, lebanon exists at the mercy of\nthe warring groups surrounding it.israel, palestine, saudi arabia, iran, syria\nand every group involved in their conflictshas contributed to endless violence in lebanon,\nwith no real end, or leadership in sight.these conflicts in the middle east are all\nincredibly complex and could easily escalate.for a break-down of what would happen if saudi\narabia and iran went to war, check out thevideo at the top.or, for an explanation of israel

make typing a  thing of the past.at apple, our philosophy is create  products that are simple to use.and nothing's more simple  than a single giant button.gilman showed me how the  revolutionary new computer works.just open the into type  alphabet menu here.scroll to the  letter you need, see?and center click  to select it.then click again to capitalize and  repeat this process for each new letter.it couldn't be simpler. -oh.you can also let the predictive sentence  technology complete the sentence for you.gilman says the macbook wheel  has also simplified the organization of files,so searching your hard  drive will be a snap.just press both sides of the wheel  concurrently, center click, and there,you have an alphabetical listing  of every file on your hard drive.everything is just a  few hundred clicks away.apple is calling the macbook wheel  the most intuitive product ever designed.here at apple we like to think that  we're giving customers featuresthey don't even

according to a study by the Pew Research Center over the next four decades questions will still belargest religious group but Islam will grow faster than any other major religion and make up 30% of the world's population we're joined By Conrad Hackett Associatesresearch and Senior demographer at Pew Research Center to help us break down the study Conrad your study shows that religious landscape in the world is changing at a very rapid ratewe can give us a snapshot of what the trends are and what's going to happen by 2050 will the biggest pattern is that well Christians are the largest group in the world Muslims are grownfastest twice as fast as the world's population about twice as fast as Christians who are roughly keeping Pace with global population growth and in the decades aheadactually we think that if we go out a little bit beyond 2050 that Muslims will eventually outnumber Christians we get to about the year 2075 or so. And we have a graph that showswe want to show it gives you a little bit more detail about the population growth it shows as you were saying about Muslims the only major religious group projected to have that increase at a faster rateis number 2 but it's so far down when you just look at the graph Excel what exactly is happening with the growth rate of Christianity itself Christians are growing rapidly in some parts of the worldbut in Europe for example which a hundred years ago was where two out of three Christians lived the population hasn't kept pace and in recent years there been more Christians dyingthen babies born to Christians in Europe in particular as was kind of geographic shift away from Europe and towards Africa in particular and asia-pacificpopulations are growing and the growth knows other regions is why globally Christians are outpacing all religious groups except for Muslims as far as growthso it's a mix of Decline and some parts of the world Western Nations as a share the population but then growth and the global South one of their interesting factshere in this study has to do with conversion from one religion to another and how that kind of factors in tell me a little bit about how you calculate conversion andwhat religions are growing in terms of converting we looked at survey data where people tell us the religion they were raised in and their Religion Today and there's religious changedifferent directions but the biggest pattern in the 70 countries where we have such data is that there are a lot of people in these countries who say they grew up Christian and nowlonger identify with a religion and as far as other religions go there's movement in and out that the biggest movement is is from Christianity to the ranks of the

fraud.tell me more about this suit,ash.ashley: yeah.listen, the sec recommendingthat e monomissing -- elon muskpay a penalty.i want to give you a couple ofstatements here in the aftermathof what the sec is claiming.first from the board.it says tesla and the board ofdirectors are fully confident inelon, his integrity and hisleadership of the company whichhas resulted in the mostsuccessful u.s. auto company inover a century.our focus remains on thecontinued ramp of model 3production and delivering forour customers, shareholder,employees.okay?that's from the board.but what about musk himself?what statement did he put out?this is it.this unjustified action by thesec leaves me deeply saddenedand disappointed.i have always taken action inthe best interests of truth,transparency and investors.integrity is the most importantvalue in my life, and the factsshow i never compromised this inany way.by the way, if the stock dropsbelow 278.45, according tocharlie brady our senior editor,that means the market value oftesla will fall below that ofgeneral motors.stuart: it's right about thatlevel right now.ashley: very close to that.&gt;&gt; market cap at this point but,yeah, it should fall below gm.ashley: citigroup also just cutit to sell, so that's comeanything as well.stuart: yes.citi says it's going to go downto 2225.right now it's 260, nearly 13%down.stay on tesla, market watchergary kaltbaum with us thismorning.gary, i know you're no fan oftesla or musk, do you think he'sdone at least as ceo at thispoint?&gt;&gt; well, i'm a big fan of muskas an innovator but not ahandler of this company.if you remember, the day after iwas on your show this was fraudin plain sight, and that's why ithink the sec was able to comeout very quickly.that's not normal for the sec todo this.i think least in big trouble.i think they mean business.i'm surprised -- i guess theyput a settlement on the table,and musk backed away, but igather that settlement had a banof a certain time frame, andthey just put the hammer down.and the biggest problem for thiscompany is they need to raisemoney going forward.they've had the wind at theirback with an easy moneyenvironment and a strong stockprice.if that changes, not good newsfor a company that loses a tonof money every time they producebe a car.so next few months going to bethe big, big stuff for thisbecause he is tesla.more than any ceo in thiscountry, means more tocountry -- maybe bezos a littlebit more to amazon, but he meansmore than any other company outthere.stuart: so if musk is eventuallyout of tesla -- and we don'tknow that, but if he is out atsome point -- you're tell thingme that tesla doesn't look likemuch of a company without him.&gt;&gt; they need to have some peoplein there that know how to runthe cap company and do thebetter with the financials.by the way, tweet was badenough, but he has beenpromising a lot of things for acouple years that never camethrough, and they'reinvestigating that also.and if i was just giving aguesstimate, i think he's worthabout $100-$150 to stock priceif he goes bye-bye.but keep in mind, this is goingto be played out over a decentperiod of time.i'm talking a lot of months, soi don't think this happensanytime soon.but leave no doubt the stockprice is going to take a hit andprobably going to go lower fromeven here on the gap todownside.stuart: hold on one

can go to100-150.you've got to remembersomething, even with the droptoday it has a market cap just alittle bit less than gm, but gmhas ten times the sales andmakes a ton of money.remember, this is a money-losingcompany, and he is very luckywe're in a bull market and aneasy money environment.if that that also changes,that's going to be a real -- idon't know a death knell for thecompany, but that's

expect frompresident trump while he's outthere?&gt;&gt; well, i mean, i assume he'sfirst of all going to take alook at the wall prototypes andsay some complementary thingsabout them but also reiteratethe message that the attorneygeneral sent earlier that thefederal government isn't, youknow, is not going to makecalifornia do things itshouldn't do but will nottolerate the kind of action thatcalifornia's taking to fullyfriday and interfere withfederal law, as the attorneygeneral said, you know, southcarolina tried this thing backin the 19th century and itdidn't work out for them.the states do not have to dothings the federal governmenttells them to do if it's an areawithin state responsibility, butstates have no right tointerfere with federal lawenforcement and the lawsuit

pretty big issues obviously technology companies have come under pressure both here and around the globe for privacy concerns what was IBM's solution to that problemyeah I did in fact I got a chance to cover up what I think for three important topics you mentioned the one in the introduction cuz we made an announcement.about what we do with AI for business which is which is going out standing here in France but it was something called call for code with the UN in the Red Cross in a dome30 million dollars over a number of years we're working on natural disasters one thing but the second thing then I dealt with was that's great you can have all this oneimpact but we have to have trust in technology and our answer to that and it's something we're sharing with the world's honestly Becky what we've lived by four decadeswe gotta fight it now put it in writing share it with everyone and it's called the IBM principles for trust and transparency and simply put the first one says the purposethese new technologies is to augment What man does the second principle is data and its insights in the AI engine to get bill pay the lawnowner the creator of that data that's a very fundamental coin and then the third is things like AI they need to be transparent and explainableBlack Box you need to know what data who trained it I mean if you really believe these things will impact important decisions things about school how your kids are atmedical decisions you make how you do underwriting you will never do that if it's a black box and you're not sure where the data and who trained it because you can train these systemsbe good or good you can train them for bias or no bias and so those are really important when you say trust those are three really important tenants I took on and thenthat we talked about but this is all great and help people do a better job everyone can do a better job with these Technologies but we do have to reinvent skills in educationyou guys have had many stories and discussions on this we have been committed to this now only four decades we've been running this new public-private partnership MagicPathway to Technologies think of it as a high school and six your high school public schools with public community colleges we're up to a pipeline of Elmo4000 kids that means you don't need a University degree to participate in this new economy and it's so critical otherwise we're going to create a world of Haves and Have Notshow do you say some big issues or tackling there at what people get concerned about AI that it means that they will be losing jobs you made the point that you're going to be creating 1800 jobs in Francegive us a little bit of insight into what your job plans are for the United States what the job plans for you might remember back a little bitthe really in associated with this new collar premise that we had said we be hiring 24,000 jobs over the next couple years and we are right on track for that andhere in France as well that was 1800 as you just said and it's around a center of excellence for AI in Forge Cloud internet of things and itreally being driven by the demands here the clients it implemented a I hear you will find great examples in real production credit Mutual Orange Bake lvmhLouis Vuitton sncf there big Railway it's quite a long list and and after one of the most aggressive countries in the world about it and this is really underpins reallypresident macron I need for my very first time I met him he has been focused on how these Technologies could be a cause for good and that was what was behind the summit he heldthey called tech for good and it had three workstreams I led the one for him on education there was one on jobs of the future and then one time one on inclusiveStar City that's great we talked about IBM and how things have been going with the company you came out with the earnings recently that we're better than expected and the revenue line internwhich is something else we have been waiting for for quite a while so the socks sold off after the earnings report and some people are saying it's because investors have lost patienceterms of waiting for a turnaround can you address that in and just say what you think the stock reaction was and where you stand with investors right nowgood luck as we've talked about I think that we have done in the team has done more than anything of great job repositioning the company and in fact what you find out asyears ago and whether that's the look at the portfolio now top 3 Cloud 18 billion take a look at our new strategic initiatives50% of a company growing 12% look at AI platform for business Quantum Computing but as well then what we've done is return to growth Becky as what youDad having 4th quarter return to growth and on in the next part of that puzzle is continuing to improve value remember we are a high-value company which is always mensingle-digit Revenue growth but then continue to move and improve your margin so as we ended last year at 47.4% of gross profit margin this is now about the neckdiscontinuing and if I talked about show the margin Improvement which I was actually as many of our owners until this pleased to see the broad-based Improvement quarter tothat you saw on margin and that's cuz that that's what now will continue so I think step-by-step is what we're doing here. And Revereversation and topic we talked a lot about and you've had a lot of early success with the blockchain doing it often times in the in the private Cloud on behalf of clientsand it's a high-margin business and yet what I wanted to ask you about was in the past month or two now Amazon has introduced its own blockchain template for the publictrying to build it into the stack and I just wonder whether the blockchain would seem like it could be a lot of great high-margin business is going to ultimately get commoditized andthat means to IBM cloudsimple to everyone in fact you can reach over to it from Amazon as well so it is out there and the most important part about blockchain the underlying Fabric and her which is whattalking about it's basically open tomorrow so it's free for everyone and then people build applications on top of it and so we build some our partners are building some you knowhave the big Network Transportation around the world there's now 200 companies chewed up food safety a hundred onboarding heremillions of transactions already soap the value in this is more around than the application to build on top of it and then as well helping customers build those applications and put thosesend the fabric is already open source and actually always has been from the beginning it Jenny one more question just going back to what we last heard from the companyafter your last earnings report the CFO from IBM made some comments to the street just saying things like don't count on the continued boost that we've seenfrom over the last couple of quarters from new Mainframe sales that that that that is something that you're not anticipating in the second half of the year that was about a month ago when we heard that can you give us an update on what you're saying those Mainframe salesI remember him saying something like that I think the comments about our Mainframe as you know when a new cycle comes outnew product a new version comes out this is the 14th they go through Cycles they boost over several quarters and then clients to a different kind of upgrade after that and sowe have seen an early Porter's always see some of the largest games around that but we continue to see really strong interest in that Mainframe in in backyardremind everyone it's a very important part of what we do our Hardware business is 9% of IBM there's 91% of other things we do to it is a verypart it runs I was just with I was with clients till midnight last night telling me about how much it how meaningful it is that it runs the banks of the telecommunication companies of the world and wetalking about things like encryption and security which is what it does so that is in and continues to be really important to that client that and that's really what we exist for the Runyou better go work on it we're still debating in this country whether the the tax reform is inducedbig companies to spend more more Capital are or whether we're just seeing BuyBacks or or other uses of the catsince the law passed if you changed any decisions about Capital deployment based on on the tax law and in the change for IBSaffects your company about I think I might have talked for us it's a headwind in the first year here but we arequarters of its tail because in the long run a competitive International tax system as what you have to have and therefore you can make the right decision at the right moment and soI said hasn't changed I think as I look and talk to so many of our clients what does matter is how they feel about the whole economic environment of which tax reform as a carhow they feel about trade how they feel about what demand is in really as you would guess they take all of those into consideration when they make those decisions and so whether you'reabout the future and I do see clients undertaking what I would call in a fairly big strategic projects that they had not taken for a while thank you for your

thatOctober 2018 got some breaking news for you too large earthquakes have struck a 6.0 earthquake has struck right in the middleof Indonesia or you're at a lombok and a 7.0 earthquake has struck over in Papa New Guinea and accept5.9 5.7 several aftershocks have also taken place this is directly next to manam volcano and kadovar volcanoand this is the middle or close to the middle of our silent Zone that we had to silence zones in the area we were lookinghere for the 7.02 strike and instead it's drop right here I'm going to consider this an earthquake forecast it since we were looking for a 7.0 earthquakelike in that location and ear we were looking for a new earthquake to strike in the 6.0 range or upper 5 so to direct earthquake forecastthe timing on this 1844 for the 6.0 and 2048 for this new 7.0 Soferthis earthquake struck then this earthquake struck and I apologize for not being here when the first 6.0 hit so we lookacross this look where are big 7.0 has just popped in a dime going to turn on the display capture at this point so you can see what I see are halfwaypoint where are 7 is is sandwiched in between our two sets of deep earthquakes and we talked about the potential of this developing over the course of this weekit is now right next to our warm spot and our other direct it at our Warren spot here now we had a deep earthquake here yesterday and I told you I waslooking back behind your over to the east now today also a mystery 50000 foot I blast was misidentifyquote on quote from here right next to Toba supervolcano in the middle in between this 5.1 in 6.0 so we've got a lot goingtoday in the West Pacific but this large earthquake may have caused a tsunami the last earthquake did this one might be on the threshold ofcausing a tsunami let's go to the Pacific tsunami warning center ptwc and see what they have listedIt's always important to go check these things guys and you should always check just to see I sometimes there may be a tsunami all while the site looks like it mightthe site is down the site is down okay well we can go to tsunami.gov most people don't know about tsunamisdifferent portal gives us the same information and we'll just take a look at it looks like we have an event message American small Guam info stateone let's see I guess we're just going to need to start with the info statement next to American Samoa and Guam earthquakepreliminary magnitude of 7.3 occurred in the New Britain region of Papua New Guinea 648 on Thursday October 11th this is their time guys so they're a little ahead of usbased on all available data there is no tsunami threat to Guam Rota Saipan from this earthquake no action is required in these areas welllet's go look at the national data buoy Center National data buoy Center see if we have anything in motion on the buoys sogo over here always check for Bowie motion so far there is not in there are buoys that are around the area that could go into motion if there's any way backso back in the South one more time we are sandwiched in between two sets of deep waves with a 7.0 earthquake about an hour and a half before thatwe got our sticks over here right next to our deep Quake so first the six then the seven both striking in Middle fulcrumthis fulfills our forecast for this week which we were looking for 7.0 activity to strike between here and heand we got it right here so that is directly next to manam volcano and kadovar which were just simultaneously erupting yesso we see those two volcanoes drop off we don't see them on the list much today and then boom we get our new 7.0 earthquake from all those blackremember one of the blast was 35000 ft high so 35000 foot high blast here just this past week and over here to the West we have to signusually erupting volcanoes as well that's crocodile in the middle of the bay or Inlet here and then awesome merapi also eruptright here in Java letting us know that something's coming so this definitely should get up and look where we are here is mount a goon on this island here and this is lawso we said watch next to a girl on the right and we said watch east of East Timor right so there they areluckily no tsunami but this definitely caused major damage in the area let's go show you WhatsApp the spot so here we arehere's the location in New Britain and there are towns along the coastline here several of them but they're somewhat smaller buttlikely cause some fairly serious damage in those smaller towns around the area the only good news is we don't have huge cities in the location ifwas a huge city right here along the coast we would see devastating damage to those huge cities but they're small towns and unfortunately we're probably not going to be hearing about thosehow much right now where is it in location in relation to our other volcanoes while zooming in on the spot going across hereJuan will one was erupting just a few days back and then we go over a year here is kadovar right here kadovar andmanam is let's see where I know I've got it marked I just have to search it but don't have them all memorized exactly where they arelet's see my Nom walking out there we go right next to cattle barI don't remember that but anyways right in the area right next to the location 7.0 earthquake when having a boatload of eruptionsback up to speed if you just now TuneIn we just saw an extremely large earthquake strike in the West Pacific 7.0 and an hour and a half before that a six-pointso first this one struck then this one struck and noticed this big earthquake is sandwiched in between our deep earthquakes that we talked about lastthe spot in between Rd Quakes are a spot where we look for large earthquake activity develop where did this come from today is the last day of our 10 day weatherwe had a 10-day warning going back to the 1st or September 30th September 30th into October 1st a deep six6 earthquake happened right here on our letter D and we should attend a warning for it then a series of other deep earthquakes happen to which you can now see raised tile the globesebet original Deep 6.6 let us to issue a warning attend a warning over to the west-world here we are on day 10 andBueno hits just like last time there was a deep 6.5 two weeks ago and then there was a 7.5 and tsunami Woodstock hereso first the 6.5 then the tsunami been a deep 6.6 nowthisnews 7.0 that's the way it's gonewe were looking for this to happen it is now have anybody in denial about her Quake forecasting can step on and issue their apology down below this video that's going to be saved over on YouTubeI will accept your apology and always you my apologies to for being rude to people over these years of having to fight to try and prevent sign it I'm up sorry for beingdo you if you doubted me but I think we may have proved arcade at least to the point where you can understand there's a progression of earthquakes and that they're related in magnitudedeep earthquakes cause shallow a larger earthquakes in that there's a flow of to the forest once you admit that then you can start doing their appropriate studying to see how the relation takes placewhy there's a relation is just to deny basic science and I don't think anybody wants to do that do you so here we are one more time 7.0 striking in the middle of our silence Zone6.0 strike in the middle of our warned area and Both earthquakes we were looking for we were looking for the seven to be coming in right here next to our light Rd used to bewell I came in east of East Timor and it came in west of our big deep 6.6 so he said he's to be steamed or west of our deep six and the year it isyou go back and watch or warning issued on Sunday night you can also talk about this on throughout the week this past week I talked about it every single night for the last10 days and here it is on day 10 so we're going to go ahead and say this is a video over on YouTube I'm going to tell everybody else we're not done yetfor these to meet look where they meet we're both Rings overlap in the next few days that's going to move same as up in Japan with a giant open area across South Japanno new eruptions at sakurajima which means South Japan Kyushu Province or looking for you to get it what size 6.5last two days since our big flare up a deep Quakes look what happened to your guys 7006 is spreading out across the West Pacific everybody laughshow me that this would be an impossibility not everybody other people who are in denial they told me this would be any possibility we couldn't get two weeks in a row where they're stepping striking and 6 is across the platepossible. You draw Bob well here we are now and the 776 is have now it because of the deep earthquake increase the deep earthquakesdial The Globe displacing the entire West Pacific played which then results in activity like this so here's what I want you to tell the people in Japanhere's what I in South Loop and here's what I want you to tell the people over here and Western Papa New Guinea in your East Timor here's what I want you to tell the people over here in Indonesianext to where you just had your mystery 50000 foot I mistake next to Toba supervolcano I want you all to behave pay attention oh here in Philain between these two sets of Weights between this 4.5 and this 4.9 the Middle Point at each location guys I want you to tell each spotthey are sandwiched in between two sets of quakes we have deep earthquakes displacing the whole played so the middle points between Arc awake or underif you live in Indonesia you're under pressure on both sides here in here in your sandwiched in the middle same with over to the east you are sandwichmiddle same with up to the northern Philippines sandwiched in the middle same with in Japan sandwiched in the middle now we could go to the middle point betweenmiddle point between our other earthquakes and there are other middle points like between this in this and between this and this and betweenso each point you're going to get hit guys we're going to see a major increase in seismic activity over the next several days in between each are halfway point every singleWaypoint to get yet if not every single one almost everyone and I know that very scientific of me so we watched between it's constantly developing so Igo over each new focal point that's here but that would take another forecast 45 minutes long to go through every single halfway point around the planet and find the new halfpoint between wakes there's one right here between 4.6 and 4.3 there's another one here big open silent Zone across the Iran in between Europethe forest over in Asia okay so we're dropping much luck do you guys have an earthquake plan with sevens and 6 is popping offthe plates now with new deep earthquakes occurring across the plate I haven't even talked about the United States we'll save that for tonight at 10 p.m. same for Central and South AmericaI would like to point something else out about this I got on earlier today and talked about this look let me take you over to the mimic tpw what are the chanceand I talked about this earlier today before any of this is happening now what are the chances that the mimic tpw would have a giant energythat shows up across the Atlantic and the Pacific and then we get our new large earthquake this is how many times nowthis type of distortion the waveform Distortion shop across vast distances across the planet and then we get a new large Quake It has torelated there's no way it could be just chance I got on earlier and talked about it and now it's sitting here on the day where we get our big earthquakes over on menhours before we start seeing weird waveform signature show up across the planet then large earthquake said there's a relation there has to bewith the Bureau of meteorology the Magneto pause here let's go look that up now let's see if we even have itibom magnetopause you're of meteorology Australia magnetopauselater and what we want to see is today is Magneto but is it bouncing around now earlier when I looked at this it was bouncing around let me go open it up so youthe best are we go so this is diameters of the earth 1510 the bow of this or the front of it is beingalways look to the sides to see you know how much is being compressed how much is being forced in at any given time so we're out past 15 to 16 Somewhere Out Thereand then it starts bouncing around throughout the day today look at that so we're getting Jocelyn around out in space as the magnetopause is being compressed as it gets compressed down1617 down to 15 to Earth's diameter compression imagine what that's going to be doing pressure wise magnetically on the inside of the Earthit's going to be too last distances out to the outside it's getting smaller and as it compresses in and as it bounces back out we start to see large earthquakedevelop it is in a nutshell we talked about this several hours ago we've been looking for this throughout the last 9 to 10 days and herewith our new 7 right in the middle of our Warren area okay have a plan and be prepared just in case take the time to develop an earthquake kitemergency kit and keep that kid ready to go by the door so if you have to grab it you never grab it and run outside if your Sheltering in place you can get it after the factif you're in your house you're just going to go underneath the table or desk and protect yourself from falling debris if you're in a brick or a cinder block house you need two eggsthe building immediately so as soon as that earthquake hit you start feeling shaking in your break or cinder block structure you're getting out of that and going outsidethat you need to know what's outside so you're not running into all worse situation then as if you are inside loan so okay take the time to make a planhave an emergency kit now the emergency kit should just cover day 1 of any disaster and I would suggest a change of clothes is that a shoes in case it's in the middle of the nightearthquake that just hit over here in Indonesia case it's in the middle of the night. You can grab your bag and go put the clothes on outside if you need toright also have a change us extra set of keys extra ID insurance card if you own anything worth insuring and you also may want tocommunication or a way to charge your cell phone that mobile phone Flashlight batteries first aid kit sanitation you can meet all those basic needs food and water tothe first day and then you grab it and you go or you grab it in you stay either way you're going to be using your emergency kit on the first day and you'll be way better off thanblue wrap nothing and have to wait for Big Brother to come save that do you want to end up in a gymnasium with cats and kids screamor do you want to be prepared and planned and on your way to your designated location if you are having to evacuate you know your designated location will be yourdesignated location if you choose it right so if you choose I want to go to this Campground 50 miles away that's far away from everybody back out the Backwoodsit's got water it's got bathroom facilities it's got a place I can put my tent in a cost 10 bucks a night everybody else can go pay those hundreds of dollars to go stay at Holiday Inn ExpressGod knows how long but you could then be free to then do what you need to do from the campsite that you would have to select a campsite for me and then be able to know how toright cuz if earthquake hits are you have to evacuate everybody's going to be on the road most people don't know where to go that's how they end up in gymnasiums with big brother Gardenand I would suggest you take the time to develop that portion of your plan as well what happens if you get this place from your house where you going to goand how you going to get there what if you can't drive the okay so anyways I'm not trying to be too serious but I do have to bring that up in lined upEvans now striking again I'll cross the West Pacific and a somewhat Going Quiet you're off the west coast of the United States will talk about the USA and everelse tonight at 10 p.m. or if anything happens between now and then if you want to know the areas were watching it already got a forecast out for this week it's maybe been seen by a few thousand piecego to the planet I got blocked this week by YouTube for being controversial they were blocking all my videos demonetized everything blocked me said I was controversial now look whatI knew 7.0 earthquake hit right in the Warren area I sure hope nobody got hurt because if they got hurt and my videos got blocked then whoever block my videosbe responsible for the people who got hurt for not allowing them to get a warning there could have been a chance for them to get the warning we were looking for 7.00to strike over here this week it did it now and if anybody's injured from not getting a warning that I would blame the people who stopped the warning wouldn't youwrite like somebody says I didn't know when earthquake was coming nobody warned me and I'll say yeah I did I went on the internet and told the whole world and put it out on all social media everywhere around the placeit just got blocked because it was controversial uci's controversial for me to tell you where to watch yeah that's a real big deal as they issue 50 different hurthurricane warning and four different spots across the entire coast and it only comes across one spot on the coast all the other tracks are wrongjust one was right there right okay or just a couple were right but they still issue those warnings and they don't block them from getting out do they and they have nowith everybody moving away and boarding up their houses even when they issue a warning in a spot where it's not coming ashore but this guy online name. Since all manthe Warren people online better stop thatI have maybe that on their hands carmelize whoever's responsible for blocking it man they got a lot to deal with now and it's not melike guys I'm going to say this is a video over on YouTube so you can get it out to the world word up and much love peace out  ", "pcOajd9GYOg": "a severe weather outbreak is threatening the Southern Plains the National Weather Service says two tornadoes of touchdown in Southwest Oklahoma and one in NorthwestTexas no injuries were reported the dangerous weather could linger into Friday areas from Texas to Kansas face the risk of violent tornadoeslarge hail and flash flooding meteorologist Jeff berardelli from our West Palm Beach affiliate in Florida is tracking the severe weather so Jeff justPrediction Center has issued a high risk for severe weather what is the significance of thatwe have a high risk and what it means is not only a lot of tornadoes but the possibility of strong tornadoes and long-lasting tornadoes we've already had a lot of tornado warnings it actuallytornadoes reported hear that Candice this is Oklahoma this is Texas that purple Bullseye something we only see a couple of times a year so that's where the threat for severe weathertake a look at all the storm reports today and noticed your two areas and believe it or not here we are at the end of May and that is snow and heavy snow in Boulder and Denverportions of the Rockies have seen over two feet of snow on the Eastern side it's a severe weather we just talked about so far 14 reports of tornadoes lots of reports of wind damage and howas well as you can see it's a solid line of very big thunderstorm supercell rotating thunderstorms here in Texas all the way through the central partof Oklahoma some lighter rain around Oklahoma City not necessarily the very severe weather right now and the worst severe weather threat right now has moved into the Kansas areasmoking images there Jeff when can we expect the threat to be over to take awhile and here's the reason we have this huge upper level storm you can see the jet streamthrough the plain states in the storms not really going to move over the next 24 hours to Watch What Happens here we are early this evening here we are by midnight with a severe weather threat moving at the Kansasand also went to Joplin by tomorrow morning severe weather the possibility of very strong Gusty winds around St Louis even tomorrow morning it's still raining in parts of Oklahomawhat would a ", "IagqnUZognU": "Erica thank you the newest 6 the myth of cyber security if you think those messages you sent her friends over popular apps as security might want to think againimportant research done by cyber experts at the University of New Haven giving new insights into the risk you run every time of use some of the most popular applications now indon't send stupid things on these applications sounds simple enough but Professor a but guilty of the University of New Haven Cypressresearch and education group knows it's a rule most people don't follow you says in the Cyber Universe privacy he is just a perception I can send you a picmyself no matter what the picture is it could be intercepted Juliana students have spent the past six months looking into the security of popular apps like2 gram OkCupid a new boo so why should you care about this well pretty much all of us have one of these with smartphone and a lot of us transmit our personal informationphotos over the web by using these mobile apps lead researcher you in a senior damn well Nikki showed us just how quickly information sent forone device to another can be compromised instantly intercepts or basically intercepting traffic so that we can see if that traffic is encrypted or noCryptid and we found that a lot of the traffic that's being sent is not encrypted meaning that when I send you a picture that picture can be very easily interceptedresearchers say they got no response from App creators when they tried to alert them about the public availability of the seemingly private communicationI think overall it's just convenience it's much more easier to go straight forward and don't Implement privacy don't think with everything I'm so it's easier to readI'm to send data on a over and cook the channel for the hundreds of millions of us to use apps there's nothing really all that private inspace but changing things won't be easy it's up to the people that I complain and to get through these developers don't really care and see my line it's for peopleshow up in arms about it hopefully hopefully I hope they do now that you wanted steam will release one video per day for the next 4 days with information about other mobilesend the rest they pose those videos are available on YouTube.
