the verge of losingknowledge of God and Faith with more on what his organization is doing to combat combat this trend is director of RC college prep and Crosspoint Community Church PastorShepherd Pastor thanks for joining us this morning so that's a number that would would surprise a lot of people and what would what is the reason this trend is happening amongst younger peopleyeah it's and it's no it's not news anymore it's old news that seemingly no young adult possesses a Biblical understanding of who God is somewhere around 6adults have what we call a Biblical worldview which is interesting because 90% of Americans still believe that God exists so the question why don't they do thatwhen they have not been taught Faithfully by the older generations and neither have the older Generations live Faithfully so younger Christians don't know whatwhy it's true and they not seen from an older generation and authentic lifestyle me what's the good that is coming from Christianity and then the culturalreinforces that same Christianity is irrational and it's in moral and young adults can't see otherwise they don't know that God exists why they should believe that and they have notsobscure form of Christianity live out amongst their parents and grandparents and the broader adult fishing communityresearch that actually go to Services you think about religion a lot of my friends existI belong to and it's their iPhones often times I mean people just sit on their technology all day long you could argue that maybe that's a way to connect with the religious communityin a lot of ways you're disconnected from it all technology is great but one of the things that the smartphone is done andthe things we find with the younger Generations is an epidemic of loneliness and so certainly through the smartphone at all of its promises and social media app connectivity what it's atit's broken actually seen that in the church exactly right fewer and fewer people come to church because when they do gothe Millennials are passionate people they can sniff out BS a mile away and so when they come in they want to be taught why is this why does it matter how is for sure consequences of how free republics are for only maintain through religious people believing in somethingwhat are the consequences we see in our society when we have less people who believe in something greater than themselves Well you certainly can see thata six-sided florist there has to be a moral undergirding moreover there has to be a belief that truth setsabsolute objective outside of

that they had a print I was pretty confident that we be able to find the right person as far as thedevices themselves it's important to say as as is in the complaint that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or notthey were functional as they say so we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain energetic material

you continue to run up along the island this is going toweakening system and by the time you get parallel there perpendicular to Honolulu at perhaps weakening down to a category 1 storm so as it gets closer to some of the major population centersit is weakening a bit but this is still a wide berth for this track and that leaves a little bit of indecision you noticed how quickly and how sharply this turns back out to sea will win that turn happenmake a big difference on what folks feel these are several different forecast models each one of these the possible track some turning out earlier others taking you all the way to landfall before turningthat's going to make a big difference on this but whether we actually hit or not it's going to be a huge Rainmaker and I think the Big Island

decreaseand frequency in traditionally prone places like Oklahoma and Kansas but tornado frequency is increasing farther east in more denselypopulated areas for more on this I want to bring in CBS News contributing meteorologist and Jeff berardelli this doesn't sound like it's greattornados but it doesn't sound like it's great news from people who live in areas that I'm prepared for it exactly right so the shift is happening towards the southeastern United StatesMidwest Midwestern used to tornado Southeast they also get tornadoes but we seem to be getting a lot more in places like Alabama Mississippi Arkansas placesis Yuri so because of that these people are less prepared and there's also another problem there a lot more trees so it's hard to see tornadoes coming and by the way climatological espeaktornadoes tend to happen at night more often in the Southeast and they do in the plane State any kind of add to that the fact that the framed homes are or not really builtbig tornadoes like they are in places like Moore Oklahoma at Safeway to get those big EF and EF 5 so there's really a a danger for disaster there inthey calculate in this paper that are the chance for potential disaster goes up by three times because of this shift to the east in the new Tornado Alleyvery scary for people in that region at what sorts of climate changes are responsible for this so here's what's happening there's dryer that's been building inSouthwest a persistent drought and that dryer doesn't stay there kind of start spreading out so it seems to be pushing the dry line which is typically wear these tornadoesMayweather initiates anybody who from the plain states knows about the dry line one side of his moist as golf are warm moist air the western side of desertTwitter seems to be progressing to the east so we're seeing the movement of what we call the 100th Meridian or the 100 longitudinal linesevere weather is moving East that's also having an impact on agriculture as well so it's it's really having a big impact Eastward shift then I am assuming it can you elaboratenow it's affecting agriculture so the problem here is it's movie about a hundred and forty miles to the East Columbia University this spring put out a whole article onand it really causes a problem for Farmers because they rely on consistent weather and climate change causes a lot of extremes now we're notpercent sure that was happening with the Tornado Story that we just did is due to climate change but the weed researchers I talk to one of them today said it probably is climate change and Columbia Universitythanks that it's this man-made climate change that's causing this dry line or the 100th Meridian for the reason basically what that means for Farmers is where you used to be able to plant corntartar now you have to plant wheat and there are farmers who are legitimately concerned about their future their lifestyle right now and passing along their Farms to their childrenand by the way to the viability of the town's where these Farms existsuddenly up and change it is that next crop that you plant as profitable what kind of economic impact does it have to the families that run these farms and for the communitiesin the area so we are seeing that shift because a climate change dictates that it's likely to get dryer in the deep Southwest and because of that dryer will continue to expandthe East and it's likely also going to cause the the frequency of tornadoes to continue to expand to these Eastward expansion mean that the tornadoes will becomedeadlier because of the region that it's entering it's very possible and again that's because of a lot of factors it's not just because there were more tornadoes in the Southeast it's because they're harder to seewrapped in drain because they're their containing golf are the plants that you can see tornadoes from dozens of miles away sometimes or at least 10 miles away or sowhen you're talking about places

testing in 2009 the laser Adventure was able to successfully track 3 unmanned aerial Vehicles during a test and shoot one of themthe only its laser obviously this device is likely to see other

for the unit to eventually be adopted by the US Army in 1983 but its remaining service ever since the most succinct way to describe the endpicture of machine gun in full operation now imagine it's firing grenades yes the unit is a belt-fed 40 mm fully automatic grenade launcher which Fires at a rate of up torounds and again by round we mean actual grenades per minute it has a ridiculous range of 1600 to 2400 yards can be fired from a vehicle Mount or a tripodis equipped with a flash suppressor not for concealing the unit position during nighttime operation but for protecting the eyesight of its operator it's an extremely versatile weapon hovering enemy helicoptersvehicles and enemy bunkers are just a few of the targets the mk19 is capable of taking out its rounds compares to in armor and they produced fragments which would kill or wound any Personnel Within15 meter radius of impact the unit is every bit as devastating as one would expect the union of machine gun and grenade launcher to be and in addition to the US there employed by nearly 30 allies aroundit might look like a mini tank but it's actually something much scarier and arms robotic Soldier the momfor modular Advanced arms robotic system isn't fully autonomous it does require an operator that the platform was designed primarily for surveillance and reconnaissance it can handle just about any TerrainUltra Tan and impacts just as much Firepower the Mars is equipped with 7 cameras so that it's operator can monitor potential threats coming from any direction and of course they can be switched to infraredfor night-time operations that unit has a 360 degree rotating turret outfitted with an m240b machine gun and for grenade launcher 2 and impacts one grenade for each 2450 rounds of ammo it can Cruise along it up to seven miles per hour and can travel up to 1,000 from the unit can be modified for non-combat purposes these systems can includespeaker a laser dazzler a siren or a manipulator on

is also used in conjunction with avessel which could be seen as the pride of the US Navy the Trident to is simply the most powerreliable missile in the arsenals of both the US and UK designed to be

the capable of hitting their targets with nearly as high degree of accuracy is land-based missilesevery bit as devastating the Triton has been in service both in the US and UK since 1990 but it's not a standalone system the marvels of modern warfare in which their house can be placed strategically at Birthany location with very little notice and they are key to ensuring that nuclear equipped enemies think very very carefully before considering that most dire of optionsthe ohio-class submarine is the largest ever built for the US military designed to carry out the term patrols aroundWorld each one is armed with up to two dozen Trident 2 missiles with each one of those equipped with a dozen multiple independently chargeable reentry Vehicles which carries its own Warheadand you'll see that each Ohio class submarine is loaded with enough nuclear Firepower to level in entire country in very little time in the United States has 18 of them these both reppossibly the most important part of the US nuclear Triad with the other two being land-based missiles and nuclear bombers simply put a first nuclear strike by an enemy against the US stand to decentwiping out a good portion of our

here as a young man walking around the streets of Milan and Verona and I became enamored with the Italian coffee bar andfortunate enough to realize my first Dream to bring that back to the US and many many years later here we are really trying to complete that Circleand we are announcing that we're opening a Roastery at the old post office and I think it's going to be spectacularyou walk around and the first thing you say is wow there coffee shops everywherestores in Seattle and we were selling coffee only for the home no no beverage that also when I came along for the first time walking to all these coffee bars and sending uscappuccino cafe latte and seeing the sense of community around coffee I realize we were kind of in the wrong sexand but what really struck me is coming back to you please bars everyday I begin to see the same people at the same time of day and it was that humanconnection that really struck me could we replicate this through the lens of an American experience and create the third place in America between home and work withFiesta beverage in Romancing it and with 25000 Plus stores and 75 countries later I think wesay with humility we we did a pretty good jobI grew up as a poor kid in Brooklyn I had no money and no resources I just a dream and I think it speaks to the American entrepreneurspirit that a young kid from public housing the promise of America and the American dream is available to mecabasa people and coffee over lost what 30 years almost all over the world from shypan to the Middle East to Latin America to Europe is that there is a universal acceptance to Starbucks because people are longinghuman connection and coffee and Starbucks has brought people together and perhaps given the environment that we're all living in today there's a longhuman connection more than ever beforeI've been asked that many times as you might imagine coming to Italy strategically it's not the biggest Market in the world but it's the mostWorld Market for me personally and for the company why because the Italians Master coffee way before Starbucks we're not coming here to teach the Italianmy coffee but we are coming here to present our interpretation of what coffee could be and I think I also realize that are sickall over the world if not going to entitle us to his success here we're going to have to earn it so we weren't ready and we have to come here withmobility and respect and reverence for all things Italian in the coffee but the site the location in my mind could nota small Starbucks store it had to be something brand and yes and so we opened our first grocery in Seattle two years ago it's massive its20000 Square ft 2000 the Roasterie at the post office will be larger more dramatic and I'm involved in everyI'm insulted seriously involved in every detail including creating this new coffee for the Milanese people it's going to be incrediblemore difficult to sell coffee to the Italians than it is to the Frenchwe'll have to see it you know I we've done some market research here not a lot but the thing that has surprises is the awareness of Starbucks especially among young peoplethe majority of young Italians has consumed Starbucks coffee and other places and there's such excitement among them so I feel pretty good aboutbut I'm taking nothing for granted talk to me aboutopen end of 28 the architecture of the building is spectacular I haverespect for what that building has represented we're going to use it to our advantage because when you walk in it's going to be we're going to take you on a magicCarpet Ride and the Roasterie in Seattle has been labeled as the Willy Wonka of coffee and we're going to take that and put it on steroidsItalian experience I literally I think people have no idea what we're about to doso romantic and love of innovation and design and creativity I think it'll be the balance of coffee art fashion Antriminnovation in terms of Technology as wellFrenchie Bakery and when I came in Italy over the last few years and had Rocco print cheese bread and pastries I knew I wasa tasting something of a true artist and I went to Rocco and I said is it possible to create a partnership with you and bring your food into a Starbucks environment hiddendone that before we flew into Seattle to see The Roastery and I think once you saw the Roasterie in Seattle a city and you going to do this and Italy I said yes and he said I will give you myso we're going to have the best possible culinary artisinal food experience coupled with a dramatic dramaticexperience for customers are you expecting it today over the next 5-10 yearsopen 10 to 12 stores a year but the Roasterie is like as many stores in onetesting your i know you've been very focused on expansionismdifficult I think the challenge whenever we open in the New Market is to present the Starbucks experience and trying to localize it for the local marketsend that well in the UK and France and Germany and Spain Italy Amino different except the true essence of everything we've done over 45 years is steeped in Italian culture and so we have to come here with tremendous humility and respectpush the subscription of orders where you're at your desk you orderwe invested way ahead of the technology in the growth curve in a mobile ecosystem in the US and today over 25%customers in North America are paying with their phone in advance and many are using it to order in advance andwell it's ready well the good news is that technology is been embraced I don't want to see the bad news but the challenge has been it's been sohighly successful that in many stores is created congestion in the morning that we are in the process of fixingnews stations that will create a opportunity for the mobile order person as well as a person to store but the point is that we've created a fantastic mobile ecowith loyalty with technology with content with rewards and we will we will be bringing that all over the world and we have a few new Suprainstead we will announce at our annual meeting with regard to technology on the 22nd of MarchI say technology I think what you're trying to do is recognize this and that is that every bricks-and-mortar retailer today must recognize that we must be asrelevant on people's smartphone and their mobile devices as we are inside our stores and we've done that as well or better than any other company in the worldChina today 3 weeks ago we announced this partnership for $0.10 and we became a a company with tension that you can do social giftingI see if me sending another person a friend or family member a latte or actually Starbucks money and that has been wildly successful in freewayand that's just the beginning social getting will be part of Starbucks all over the world in timewill China for Starbucks people don't realize we've been in China for 17 years we have 2600 stores in China in over a hundred twenty five citiesopen a new store in China every day it's been a fantastic market for us and the Roasterie the next Roastery which will be 30,000cheap 3000 meters on Nanjing Road will be incredible opening in December and I said publicly that China probably will exceed the USin terms of the number of stores we just introduced we haven't said what year but I think it will be bigger than the us over timewe just brought our consumer products business to China in a partnership with teeny so ready to drink bottled Frappuccino is now in Chinaand we're also doing things in China for our customers and our partners as an example we have an annual meeting that I attendyear for the parents of our people around Floyd's in to honor and respect the family and I think again this is another opportunity to demonstrateHumanity of the company and being locally relevant not only on things that are customer-facing but also for our own peopledifferently to the Italians or the French do the Chinese you know take a lot more takeaway coffees or they sit down and have it theredifferent but every Market in the same let me explain the equity of the Starbucks brand in Seattle 45 years agoand today everywhere in the world is exactly the same and what I mean by that is we are sourcing and roasting the highest quality coffee in the world we have great designstore locations for the equity the vran is based on the experience experience comes to life with the people who wear the green apron Our obligationsponsibility as managers and leaders is to exceed the expectations of our own people so they can exceed the expectations of the customer the 331do people all over the world who wear the green apron 91 million customers last week came into Starbucks stores they didn't comebecause of advertising or marketing or because of Technology that's the price of admission they came in because of the emotional relationship they have with our people in theexperience that exist in our stores and that experience is universally accepted all over the world and hopefully it'll be accepted here in Italyhow to how to do itchy dry recognizable brandspeople know that's that that Starbucks has has created a business plan over the years that was based on the balance of profit and social infirst company to give equity in a form of stock options Comprehensive Health Insurance every employee 2 years ago free college tuition in China we just gave housing allowanceto our employees are Partners who are traveling long distances not every decision in my view is economicthe price of admission is financial performance but I don't wake up everyday saying how we going to make more money how we going to ring the register I wake up every day saying how can we reallya deep sense of loyalty with our people in our customers based on our values are guiding principles and listen we are living in a world 2that is very fragile and there's a lot of uncertainty and I think we have an obligation and a responsibility as a cuphow to add value to humanity and In-N-Out if I could say it in my own parlance but this is a time where I think we as privatesand as business people I need to build Bridges not wallsthat decision was not a political decision it was decision based on the values of our company and and our guiding principles andyou know I believe very strongly that your station in life your sexual preference the color of your skin the c***newborn in should not Define the opportunities that we have as people and if Starbucks as a company can createan environment where the on entrepreneurial Spirit and the opportunity for everyone is based on Merit then I think we're doing a pretty good joband that's what I want to try and do it's a company I'm still very very optimistic we clearly are going throughchange and inflection point politically but I am I am the quintessential optimist about the promise of America the American dream and I wantedI can to advance dad and be a a symbol for American entrepreneurial ship and also a values-based companydoing I think more and more people recognize that we have a collective responsibility as business people not just to make money but the add value back to our society in the people that we employhow should big lifted seos deal I can't speak for other CEOs I can only speak for myself and you know how I want America to succeedcan and do everything I can to do to be of helpquite exciting and that is build an Ultra Premium brand Starbucks Reserve buildings roasteries and most importantly enter Italyhow much of this is actually a sense of Personal Achievement that you've entered into I was talking to my kidsthis is a very very emotional moment for me I've waited a long time to do this the post office site I feelwas just meant to be wait waiting for us so this is a pretty significant milestone for me personpoliticians allowed in Europe I'm trying in a sense to understand the worldmy my own understanding and Sensibility I've been asked to speak to many many places and speaking at the University of Tampa noonand give me an ambassador for the country and and also try and demonstrate a high degree of sensibilityabout the things that I think are really important to build a great injuring society and that is to embrace humanity and once again not toomyself but this is the time in the world to build Bridges not wallslightning Starbucks because of taxescriticizing any particular person or municipality sometimes a company that is Iconic at Starbuckspulled into things that the stealth story is not really cold I only paid 18 million pounds of taxhere in the UK I think that is emblematic of our commitment to do things the right way I personally believe a hundred percent incurrency and want to do everything we can to make sure that there's trust and everything we do and and we are an open booktaxes are refugees or or do you do it as a CEO no matter whata hundred percent of the time never knew anything else that would even remotely be inconsistent with being ethical and doing the right thing with regard to thedecision about refugees or things of that nature I think it's important to embrace your core purpose in your reasonin all aspects of the business and Leadership and being a strong leader I can't be when it's convenientit's easy to be great leader when you have the wind at your back that's little harder when you have the wind in your face and I think leadership is definedmany many times when you have to make a tough but just decision and I know we employ over 330,000 people andwhat up what question I ask myself when we are making tough decisions is is this decision going to make our people proud and that's the litmus testour profitability and our financial success as a public company in 25 years is a record of incredible achievement and that is cheapis based on the fact that we have done the right thing and it's cheating The Fragile balance between profit social impact and being a values-based company we're not perfectwe make mistakes but our heart our soul and our commitment to humanity is always at the frontthe toughest decision I had to make when I came back to Starbucks in 08 as CEO during the cataclysmicprices are we at the clothes many many stores the first time in our history we had to do that that was a very tough decision because it was in aYakima to the growth and development of the company we've been a blessed company I look back on where I grew up in my own historyI wish my parents were alive to see what we've been able to do and feel very blessed that we had tough decisions but I wouldn't trade anything for what we'vego to do and and I I would say metaphorically I think about our situation as a reservoir we want to make thenot withdrawals in the reservoir of humanity and I want to think about how do we do that and do that in a way in which we can be the kind of companyin a sense that has reinvented the role and responsibilities of a public company with words that are not taught in business school

time to embrace those characteristics and attributes and it's good businesspediatric people find out what you do is it possible through social media can be a double-edged sword social media can

company is I want to live in a currency of trustthis is from the little boy that you were back in Brooklyn I mean have you always been this wayplay poor kid and I think I carry that sensibility with me and I have a lot of concern and empathyfor lots of people who are being left behind in America and around the world and if I can do things in the position and I'm in to be a voiceto be help then I want to try and do that the person or the people that influenced me the mostbecause my mother was not a educated person and I've told the story before when I was you have time for this or Okay soI'm growing up in public housing in Brooklyn New York I'm 6 or 7 years old and my mother takes me by the hand not knowing where we're goingand we're walking and walking and walking feels like miles and we get to a rally a huge rally and I'm a young boy and I can't see over anyonehad but I can hear and who do I hear I hear a young Senator running for President John F Kennedy in Brooklyn in New Yorkand I think my mother's hand is gripping my hand Tighter and I can look up in her face and I see her face smiling and she's beforebecause he's speaking to her and what is he saying he's talking about optimism he's talking about opportunity and he saying to her and thenmen's tennis youngboy regardless of your station in life that America the promise of the country is for you and thatthat experience changed me and as I said Iit's not only the idea of being a six or seven year old boy but it's my mother's believe in America and my mother in printing and me that regardless of whereliving or the fact we had no money that you have opportunity and that's why I'm so sensitive right now toochange the world segregate and discriminate and I think we got to be very careful and very mindfulthat there are millions of people who deserve an opportunity and they have talent and they have assets and I have resources and Americahas been a land of immigrants and so I feel and unusual level of empathy and compassionto try and recognize that they're probably two sides of the story and perhaps we should be openflash against globalization is it Innovation if you can't answer that question in in one sentencethere are lots of different factions and I think we just have to be true to what we believe inwhat I'm doing today is what I want to doI probably been working for 3 years so I comeevery year and I work you can't come to Italy for work and I have pleasure you know thatso I have lots of friends here and I've been helped and guided by the fact thatthis is the right time for us to come Brunello cucinelli is a very good friend of mine and he's been a good resource for me I spend actually Saturday with himand looking around the real estate my friends adjara have helped me Pablo's been a great help I'm lookingand my friends in Spain so this is the right time and then I saw this location andwith the municipality and the fact that the those are the building is owned by Blackstone so I was able toStarbucks Story the mayor's been very helpful and also the fact that we want to build something that does not exist here that was the kind of reachexperience that will read the fine I don't

space and it's going to be incredible it'll open towards the end of 18wish you was coming sooner and we're going to wait to open the additional stores because we think the Roasterie has to be the quintessential moment and hopefully you'll come back to dowhat comes after what we have roasteries now ShanghaiMilan New York is under construction in the Meatpacking District Tokyo's been announced and they'll be another US city announced probably at our annual meetingMarch 22nd and we'll see from thereright about what we what happens next do people need to regroup I don't know if it's liberals or how you want to call the the people that believe in globalizationor Building Bridges I don't think the the issue is globalizationI think the issue right now is Wink we are we're not if we we need to embracehumanity and I don't think you can you can link that to globalization as the issue and I'm not a politician I'm really hereabout Starbucks I have concerns but I do have great faith and great optimism both in the American peopleand are greater society-at-large and that the world will be in a good place but we are going through an inflection point and I think we've been through what we've been through inflection points bewe will get through this business and finance do you worry about currency fluctuations or is elevated because it's out of your hands45 years machine lot of lots of cyclical changes in currency and commodity prices like the weather we have we have to manage through itopen the size at Starbucks has become in so little time wonderingwhat do you tell them is there common mistake that they should avoid surround yourself with people with like-minded valueswe people love experience and are smarter than you are but like minded values you have to realize that there are going to bechallenges and obstacles and people are going to come to you and tell you perhaps you're dreaming too big and this can't be and the difference I thinkbetween winning and losing is that unbridled level of unbelievable passionEminem courage to overcome those challenges and if you look at the last few years the entrepreneurial spirit is more aliveand well than ever before in part because of Technology but also because of the entrepreneurial Innovative spirit that is not only american-basedAmericans are better at it I don't know if that's true or not I think we get too much credit about thatfor now at what he's done and Italy Against All Odds and end he's making the product and committed to making it in Italy it says so much about himconsumers willing to pay for itor capital and resources and maybe that is one of the reasons but I don't think you can say Americans are better at it than anyone elseonfor your employees success is best when it shared that is pretty simpleI think I just came from recognizing that's how life should be I think every decision that I trymake it through the lens of recognizing we have to make our people proud we have to share success and we have to achieve that frown fragile balance between profit and social impactMN and nope no business no you can't create a great and during business if your sole motivation every single day isto make money it's a shallow goal you're not going to attract and retain great people and be the essence of building a great enduring company is culture and Valleythe culture has to be a situation in which people feel like they're part of something larger than themselves because there's truth and people believe in the missionthat has to be values-based well as I said earlier financial performance is the price of admission we have to performbut I think what I said humbly and respectfully for 25 years as a public CEO is we want to build rated during company but weTake the Long View and you look at our financial history and our success I think we get pretty high marks for for significantly Creevalue for a chauvinist way above our peer group and what I'm most proud of this we've done that not on the backs of our people but by sharing itare people and sharing it in the community this year we opened a store in Ferguson Missouri in Jamaica Queens that we fired almost 10,000 batterieswe're doing things today said no company ever dream they could do give free college tuition to every employee because that's the right thing to do and it will createbetter relationships will attract rate people higher-performance higher commitment so all these things are threaded into a set of valuesand that is how we have tried to build our company but in the end we're not perfect we make mistakes

laura: in these final weeksof campaigning we are learningmore about all three candidatesthat should give all the votersin their respective statesreason to question the nonstopheight.let's start with andrew gillum.text messages reveal that thetallahassee mayor excepted ahotel room, tours and tickets tothe broadway show hamilton forreal estate developers.without ever disclosing thegifts.only those developers wereundercover fbi agents and thedevelopers had been in touchwith me or gillam about areal estate project intallahassee.his opponent ron desantisrepublican, confronted him withall this at their debate onsunday.&gt;&gt; the question is, did you payfor the hamilton ticket or didthe undercover fbi agent pay?&gt;&gt; i'm a hardworking person, andi know that may not fit yourdescription of what people likeme do but i work hard foreverything i've gotten in mylife and i don't need anyonehanding anything to me for free.&gt;&gt; laura: it gillam got adifferent answer with chuck toddyesterday.&gt;&gt; with florida voters after 15years, i served honorably,respectively, and have served mycommunity without so much as astain on my record or on thename.&gt;&gt; laura: he spinning asbadly.and text messages just releasedby gillam's lobbyist friend,he's told clearly on august 10thof the 16th that mike miller andcrew have tickets to hamilton at8:00 p.m.awesome news, gillam texted inresponse.now whether his brother gave hima ticket or not, he knew thesource of the ticket.we suppose a developer whoneeded his help.this is why the state of floridaethics commission investigatedgalen.the probe remains open and thedemocrats florida star seems tobe falling.tonight at his second and lastdebate against disanto's, gillamwas pressed on the issue andthings got hot.&gt;&gt; he wants you to believe he'snot under investigation.&gt;&gt; i take responsibility for nothaving asked more questions.i'm running for governor and inthe state of florida we got alot of issues.&gt;&gt; nice try, but i would like tohave been in the room where ithappens.i suggest that gillam moves tosan francisco where his viewsand his style of politics wouldfit perfectly.now let's move onto thegovernor's race.in georgia where this videofootage of gubernatorialcandidate stacy abrams surface.now it shows her and others onthe steps of the georgia capitalearning the state flag

legislatureto amend the flag, change it andremove the confederate symbolthat people found offensive.so does a candidate for governorconsider it right to simplydestroy public images or symbolsthat some individuals findoffensive?that's a question that thepeople of georgia have toanswer.and then, there is super beto.yes, some street artist istrying to depict o'rourke, whosereal name is robert francis,

actually seeingthe light reflected from a star", "8XQ1onjXJK0": "g'day, my name's kevin.i'm from australia. i'm here to help.(laughter)tonight, i want to talk about\na tale of two cities.one of those cities is called washington,\nand the other is called beijing.because how these two capitals\nshape their futureand the future of the united states\nand the future of chinadoesn't just affect those two countries,it affects all of usin ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:the air we breathe, the water we drink,the fish we eat,\nthe quality of our oceans,the languages we speak in the future,the jobs we have,\nthe political systems we choose,and, of course, the great questions\nof war and peace.you see that bloke? he's french.his name is napoleon.a couple of hundred years ago,he made this extraordinary projection:\"china is a sleeping lion,\nand when she awakes,the world will shake.\"napoleon got a few things wrong;he got this one absolutely right.because china is today\nnot just woken up,china has stood up\nand china is on the march,and the question for us allis where will china goand how do we engage\nthis giant of the 21st century?you start looking at the numbers,\nthey start to confront you in a big way.it's projected that china will become,by whichever measure --\nppp, market exchange rates --the largest economy in the worldover the course of the decade ahead.they're already\nthe largest trading nation,already the largest exporting nation,already the largest manufacturing nation,and they're also the biggest\nemitters of carbon in the world.america comes second.so if china does become\nthe world's largest economy,think about this:it'll be the first timesince this guy was on\nthe throne of england --george iii, not a good friend\nof napoleon's --that in the world we will have\nas the largest economya non-english speaking country,a non-western country,a non-liberal democratic country.and if you don't think\nthat's going to affectthe way in which the world\nhappens in the future,then personally, i think\nyou've been smoking something,and it doesn't mean you're from colorado.so in short, the question\nwe have tonight is,how do we understand this mega-change,which i believe to be the biggest change\nfor the first half of the 21st century?it'll affect so many things.it will go to the absolute core.it's happening quietly.\nit's happening persistently.it's happening in some senses\nunder the radar,as we are all preoccupied withwhat's going in ukraine,\nwhat's going on in the middle east,what's going on with isis,\nwhat's going on with isil,what's happening with\nthe future of our economies.this is a slow and quiet revolution.and with a mega-change\ncomes also a mega-challenge,and the mega-challenge is this:can these two great countries,china and the united states --china,the middle kingdom,and the united states,m\u011bigu\u00f3 --which in chinese, by the way,\nmeans \"the beautiful country.\"think about that -- that's the name\nthat china has given this countryfor more than a hundred years.whether these two great civilizations,\nthese two great countries,can in fact carve out a common futurefor themselves and for the world?in short, can we carve out a futurewhich is peaceful and mutually prosperous,or are we looking at a great challengeof war or peace?and i have 15 minutes\nto work through war or peace,which is a little less timethan they gave this guy to write a book\ncalled \"war and peace.\"people ask me, why is it that a kid\ngrowing up in rural australiagot interested in learning chinese?well, there are two reasons for that.here's the first of them.that's betsy the cow.now, betsy the cow was one\nof a herd of dairy cattlethat i grew up with on a farm\nin rural australia.see those hands there?\nthese are not built for farming.so very early on, i discovered\nthat in fact, working in a farmwas not designed for me,\nand china was a very safe removefrom any career in australian farm life.here's the second reason.that's my mom.anyone here ever listen\nto what their mom told them to do?everyone ever do what\ntheir mom told them to do?i rarely did,but what my mom said to me was,one day, she handed me a newspaper,a headline which said,\nhere we have a huge change.and that change is china\nentering the united nations.1971, i had just turned 14 years of age,and she handed me this headline.and she said, \"understand this, \nlearn this,because it's going to affect your future.\"so being a very good student of history,i decided that the best thing\nfor me to do was, in fact,to go off and learn chinese.the great thing about learning chineseis that your chinese teacher\ngives you a new name.and so they gave me this name:k\u00e8, which means to overcome or to conquer,and w\u00e9n, and that's the character\nfor literature or the arts.k\u00e8 w\u00e9n, conqueror of the classics.any of you guys called \"kevin\"?it's a major lift from being called kevin\nto be called conqueror of the classics.(laughter)i've been called kevin all my life.have you been called kevin all your life?would you prefer to be called\nconqueror of the classics?and so i went off after that\nand joined the australian foreign service,but here is where pride -- before pride,\nthere always comes a fall.so there i am in the embassy in beijing,off to the great hall of the peoplewith our ambassador, who had asked me\nto interpret for his first meetingin the great hall of the people.and so there was i.if you've been to a chinese meeting,\nit's a giant horseshoe.at the head of the horsehoe\nare the really serious pooh-bahs,and down the end of the horseshoe\nare the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,the junior woodchucks like me.and so the ambassador\nbegan with this inelegant phrase.he said, \"china and australia\nare currently enjoying a relationshipof unprecedented closeness.\"and i thought to myself,\"that sounds clumsy. that sounds odd.i will improve it.\"note to file: never do that.it needed to be a little more elegant,\na little more classical,so i rendered it as follows.[in chinese]there was a big pause\non the other side of the room.you could see the giant pooh-bahs\nat the head of the horseshoe,the blood visibly draining\nfrom their faces,and the junior woodchucks\nat the other end of the horseshoeengaged in peals of \nunrestrained laughter.because when i rendered his sentence,\"australia and china are \nenjoying a relationshipof unprecedented closeness,\"in fact, what i said was that\naustralia and chinawere now experiencing fantastic orgasm.(laughter)that was the last time\ni was asked to interpret.but in that little story,\nthere's a wisdom, which is,as soon as you think you know something\nabout this extraordinary civilizationof 5,000 years of continuing history,there's always something new to learn.history is against uswhen it comes to the u.s. and chinaforging a common future together.this guy up here?he's not chinese and he's not american.he's greek. his name's thucydides.he wrote the history\nof the peloponnesian wars.and he made this extraordinary observationabout athens and sparta.\"it was the rise of athens\nand the fear that this inspired in spartathat made war inevitable.\"and hence, a whole literature about\nsomething called the thucydides trap.this guy here? he's not american\nand he's not greek. he's chinese.his name is sun tzu.\nhe wrote \"the art of war,\"and if you see his statement underneath,\nit's along these lines:\"attack him where he is unprepared,\nappear where you are not expected.\"not looking good so far\nfor china and the united states.this guy is an american.\nhis name's graham allison.in fact, he's a teacher\nat the kennedy schoolover there in boston.he's working on a single project\nat the moment, which is,does the thucydides trap\nabout the inevitably of warbetween rising powers\nand established great powersapply to the future\nof china-u.s. relations?it's a core question.and what graham has done\nis explore 15 cases in historysince the 1500sto establish what the precedents are.and in 11 out of 15 of them,let me tell you,they've ended in catastrophic war.you may say, \"but kevin --or conqueror of the classics --that was the past.we live now in a world\nof interdependence and globalization.it could never happen again.\"guess what?the economic historians\ntell us that in fact,the time which we reached\nthe greatest pointof economic integration and globalizationwas in 1914,just before that happened, world war i,a sobering reflection from history.so if we are engaged\nin this great questionof how china thinks, feels,and positions itself\ntowards the united states,and the reverse,how do we get to the baselineof how these two countries\nand civilizationscan possibly work together?let me first go to, in fact,china's views of the u.s.\nand the rest of the west.number one: china feels\nas if it's been humiliatedat the hands of the west\nthrough a hundred years of history,beginning with the opium wars.when after that, the western powers\ncarved china up into little pieces,so that by the time\nit got to the '20s and '30s,signs like this one appeared\non the streets of shanghai.[\"no dogs and chinese allowed\"]how would you feel if you were chinese, in your own country, \nif you saw that sign appear?china also believes and feelsas if, in the events of 1919,\nat the peace conference in paris,when germany's colonies were given backto all sorts of countries\naround in the world,what about german colonies in china?they were, in fact, given to japan.when japan then invaded china in the 1930sthe world looked away and was indifferent\nto what would happen to china.and then, on top of that,\nthe chinese to this day believethat the united states and the westdo not accept the legitimacy\nof their political systembecause it's so radically different\nfrom those of us who comefrom liberal democracies,and believe that the united states\nto this day is seekingto undermine their political system.china also believes\nthat it is being containedby u.s. allies and by those\nwith strategic partnerships with the u.s.right around its periphery.and beyond all that,\nthe chinese have this feelingin their heart of hearts\nand in their gut of gutsthat those of us in the collective westare just too damned arrogant.that is, we don't recognize\nthe problems in our own system,in our politics and our economics,and are very quick\nto point the finger elsewhere,and believe that, in fact,\nwe in the collective westare guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.of course, in international relations,it's not just the sound\nof one hand clapping.there's another country too,\nand that's called the u.s.so how does the u.s.\nrespond to all of the above?the u.s. has a response to each of those.on the question of\nis the u.s. containing china,they say, \"no, look at the history of\nthe soviet union. that was containment.\"instead, what we have done\nin the u.s. and the westis welcome china\ninto the global economy,and on top of that, welcome them\ninto the world trade organization.the u.s. and the west say china cheatson the question\nof intellectual property rights,and through cyberattacks\non u.s. and global firms.furthermore, the united states\nsays that the chinese political systemis fundamentally wrongbecause it's at such fundamental varianceto the human rights, democracy,\nand rule of law that we enjoyin the u.s. and the collective west.and on top of all the above,\nwhat does the united states say?that they fear that china will,\nwhen it has sufficient power,establish a sphere of influence\nin southeast asia and wider east asia,boot the united states out,and in time, when it's powerful enough,unilaterally seek to change\nthe rules of the global order.so apart from all of that,\nit's just fine and dandy,the u.s.-china relationship.no real problems there.the challenge, though,\nis given those deep-rooted feelings,those deep-rooted emotions\nand thought patterns,what the chinese call \"s\u012bw\u00e9i,\"\nways of thinking,how can we craft a basis\nfor a common future between these two?i argue simply this:we can do it on the basis on a frameworkof constructive realism\nfor a common purpose.what do i mean by that?be realistic about the things\nthat we disagree on,and a management approach\nthat doesn't enableany one of those differences\nto break into war or conflictuntil we've acquired\nthe diplomatic skills to solve them.be constructive in areas of the\nbilateral, regional and global engagementbetween the two,which will make a difference\nfor all of humankind.build a regional institution\ncapable of cooperation in asia,an asia-pacific community.and worldwide, act further,like you've begun to do\nat the end of last yearby striking out against climate changewith hands joined together\nrather than fists apart.of course, all that happens\nif you've got a common mechanismand political will to achieve the above.these things are deliverable.but the question is,\nare they deliverable alone?this is what our head\ntells us we need to do,but what about our heart?i have a little experience\nin the question back homeof how you try to bring\ntogether two peopleswho, frankly, haven't had\na whole lot in common in the past.and that's when i apologized\nto australia's indigenous peoples.this was a day of reckoning\nin the australian government,the australian parliament,\nand for the australian people.after 200 years of unbridled abuse\ntowards the first australians,it was high time that we white folks\nsaid we were sorry.the important thing --(applause)the important thing that i remember\nis staring in the facesof all those from aboriginal australiaas they came to listen to this apology.it was extraordinary to see, for example,old women telling me the stories\nof when they were five years oldand literally ripped away\nfrom their parents,like this lady here.it was extraordinary for me\nto then be able to embraceand to kiss aboriginal elders\nas they came into the parliament building,and one woman said to me,it's the first time a white fella\nhad ever kissed her in her life,and she was over 70.that's a terrible story.and then i remember\nthis family saying to me,\"you know, we drove all the way\nfrom the far north down to canberrato come to this thing,drove our way through redneck country.on the way back, stopped at a cafe\nafter the apology for a milkshake.\"and they walked into this cafe\nquietly, tentatively, gingerly,a little anxious.i think you know what i'm talking about.but the day after the apology,\nwhat happened?everyone in that cafe,\nevery one of the white folks,stood up and applauded.something had happened in the hearts\nof these people in australia.the white folks, our aboriginal\nbrothers and sisters,and we haven't solved\nall these problems together,but let me tell you,\nthere was a new beginningbecause we had gone not just to the head,we'd gone also to the heart.so where does that conclude\nin terms of the great questionthat we've been asked\nto address this evening,which is the future\nof u.s.-china relations?the head says there's a way forward.the head says there is a policy framework,\nthere's a common narrative,there's a mechanism\nthrough regular summitryto do these things\nand to make them better.but the heart must also find a way\nto reimagine the possibilitiesof the america-china relationship,and the possibilities of china's\nfuture engagement in the world.sometimes, folks, we just need\nto take a leap of faithnot quite knowing where we might land.in china, they now talk about\nthe chinese dream.in america, we're all familiar\nwith the term \"the american dream.\"i think it's time, across the world,that we're able to think also\nof something we might also calla dream for all humankind.because if we do that,we might just change the waythat we think about each other.[in chinese]that's my challenge to america.\nthat's my challenge to china.that's my challenge to all of us,but i think where there's a will\nand where there is imaginationwe can turn this into a futuredriven by peace and prosperityand not once again repeatthe tragedies of war.i thank you.(applause)chris anderson: thanks so much for that.\nthanks so much for that.it feels like you yourself\nhave a role to play in this bridging.you, in a way, are uniquely placed\nto speak to both sides.kevin rudd: well, what we australians\ndo best is organize the drinks,so you get them together in one room,\nand we suggest this and suggest that,then we go and get the drinks.but no, look, for all of us\nwho are friendsof these two great countries,\namerica and china,you can do something.you can make a practical contribution,and for all you good folks here,next time you meet someone from china,sit down and have a conversation.see what you can find out about\nwhere they come from and what they think,and my challenge for all\nthe chinese folkswho are going to watch\nthis ted talk at some timeis do the same.two of us seeking to change the world\ncan actually make a huge difference.those

Chrissy 3pl on the good side this robot that can do everything that a human can do if a little bit off and or something like the Matrix or the Terminator that aretruly intelligent robots are going to take over the world Technologies that's gotten that have made everybody really excited about prediction today aboutmachine learning and a lot of it was invented in Toronto or Montreal or university Albertafeeling this information and so you can think about it as a drop in the cost of production of prediction because normally you would be payingpeople to crunch numbers Etc absolutely be playing people or you be working with machines and maybe you'll be very expensive to go to happen and so if you think about itthen we we have a sense of what happens when the price of the tickets cheaper something cheap we we buy all sorts of new applicationnot a dream. So the first use of a hide first use of production machines has been good old-fashioned production problems you go into a bank loanand they predict the likelihood that you're going to pay them back or you're in default that's an old production problem you're going to die absolutelyI'm so but what's happeninglike I asked medical diagnosis so what do you do when you go to the doctor the doctor takes information on your symptoms and feels into missing information about what disease you have what's causing itprediction as a production process of filling in missing information and increasingly machines are getting good at diagnosis but even things likelong as you recognize the art of finding new production problem and your point is that the AI May provide the prediction but we're always going to need the humans to make afind out what should be done with this information absolutely so she was going to do two things right then you just tell the machines hey what what prediction should we makeuseful and then once we have one what do we do with it so you need to tell between even and one of these good old fashion production problems like How likely isn't somebody going to default on your loanI need to be able to tell the machine that that's an important problem with something worth predicting and then once they get the prediction oh this person is only 5% likely to default then you needmachine well does that mean we should lending the money or not so there's the Judgment went to see the prediction you still eatingCisco and that a number of companies like Facebook and Netflix and Google are interested in what you have to say what is it that you think that they are most curious to knowso what we've done is give people a framework to talk about machine learning and AI that allows the techto communicate with his people and so the language of technology whether it's talking about inference or pattern recognition doesn't really havebusiness and business people understand the idea of uncertainty and so what prediction is is it helps you deal with uncertainty it helps youuncertainty is an important business problem and so what we've done is made the language easier so

mess.after 6 years, the conflict is divided between\nfour sides,each side with foreign backers.and those foreign backers don't even agree\nwith each other on who they are fighting forand who they are fighting against.and now, syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons has\nprovoked president donald trump to directlyattack syrian president bashar al-assad.this is a major development, because, up until now,the us has only been focused on fighting isis.to understand the criss-crossing interventions\nand battle lines in syria today, and how itgot this way, it helps to go back to the beginning of the conflictand watch to see how it unfolded.the first shots in the war were fired, in march\n2011, by syrian dictator bashar al-assad againstpeaceful arab spring demonstrators.in july the protestersstart shooting back,and some syrian troops\neven defect from the syrian army to join them.they call themselves the free syrian army\nand the uprising becomes a civil war.extremists from around the region and the world start traveling to syria to join the rebels.now, assad actually encourages this by releasing\njihadist prisoners to tinge the rebellionwith extremism and make it harder for foreign\nbackers to support them.in january 2012, al-qaeda forms a new branch\nin syria, jabhat al-nusra.also around that time, syrian kurdish groups, who\nhad long sought autonomy,take up arms andinformally secede from assad's rule in the\nnorth.that summer is when syria becomes a proxy\nwar.iran, assad's most important ally, intervenes\non his behalf.by the end of 2012, iran is sending daily\ncargo flights and has hundreds of officerson the ground.at the same time, the oil-rich arab states\non the persian gulf begin sending money andweapons to the rebels, mainly to counter iran\u2019s\ninfluence.iran steps up its influence in turn,in mid-2012 when hezbollah,\n a lebanese militia backed by iran,invades to fight along assad.in turn the gulf states respond,saudi arabia really stepping up this time,to send more money and weaponsto the rebels,this time through jordan who\nalso opposes assad.by 2013, the middle east is divided betweenmostly sunni powers, generally supporting the rebels,and shias, generally supporting assad.that april, the obama administration,horrified by assad's atrocities and the mounting death toll,signs a secret order authorizing the\ncia to train and equip syrian rebels.but the program stalls.at the same time, the us quietly urges arab\ngulf states to stop funding extremists, buttheir requests basically go ignored.in august, the assad regime uses chemical weapons, provoking condemnation around the worldobama: \"men, women, and children lying inrows \u2013 killed by poison gas...\"it is in the national security interests of\nthe united states to respond to the assadregime's use of chemical weapons\nthrough a targeted military strike.russia proposed on monday that syria surrender\ncontrol over its chemical weapons to the internationalcommunity for its eventual dismantling, to avoid a usmilitary strike.the us ends up backing down, but the whole thing establishes syria asa great-powers dispute, with russia backing assad and the us opposing him.just weeks later, the first american cia training\nand arms reach syrian rebels.the us is now a participant in the war.in february 2014, something happens that transforms\nthe war:an al-qaeda affiliate, based mostlyin iraq, breaks away from the group over internal\ndisagreements.the group calls itself the islamic state of\niraq and syria, or isis,and it becomes al-qaeda's enemy.isis mostly fights not assad, but other\nrebels and kurds, carving out a mini-stateit calls its caliphate.that summer, it marches across iraq seizing\nterritory, galvanizing the world against it.in september, one year after the us almost\nbombed assad, it begins bombing isis.obama: \u201cwe're moving ahead with our campaign\nof airstrikes against these terrorists,and we're prepared to take action against\nisil in syria as well.\u201dthat summer, in july, the pentagon launches\nits own program to train syrian rebels \u2014but will only those who'll fight isis, not assad.the program fizzles, showing that america\nnow opposes isis more than assad, but that there's alsono like-minded syrian proxy forces on the ground in syria.in august, turkey starts bombing kurdish groups in\niraq and in turkey,even as these kurdish groups are fightisis in syria. but turkey doesn't bomb isis.this gets to one of the big problems in this conflict:the us sees isis\nas its main enemy, but the us\u2019 allies liketurkey and a lot of other middle eastern states have\nother priorities.this makes for a lot of unclear and confusing alliances.the next month, in september, russia intervenes\non behalf of assad, sending a few dozen militaryaircraft to a long-held russian base in the\ncountry.russia says it's there to bomb isis,but in fact only ends up bombinganti-assad rebels, including somebacked by the us.the next year, donald trump wins the white\nhouse,vowing to stay out of syria, and signalingthat assad should be able to stay in power.at the end of 2016, assad, helped by russian\nairpower and iranian sponsored militias, retakesthe syrian city of aleppo,knocking the rebels\nout of their last remaining urban stronghold.then, in spring 2017, assad once again\nuses chemical weapons against his people,killing 85, including 20 children.back in the us, trump says his attitude toward\nsyria and assad has \u201cchanged very much\u201ddue to the attacks.he vows to respondand within days the white house launches dozens\nof tomahawk missiles that strike an airbase in syria.this is the first time the united states has directly attacked the assad regime.this adds yet another criss crossing complication\nto an already multidimensional civil war.so as it stands now, syria is in ruins.even as assad recaptures land, the rebellion\nperseveres.and with outside countries fueling each of\nthe groups, it\u2019s clear that there is stillno end in sight.", "j3kdr4Rjnus": "that's what it is.that's where we are.so the democrats want openborders, let everybody come

become intense we do have a tropical storm warning in effect for almost the entire viewing area national weathershot in the olden days 3 or 4 years ago they had the high wind warnings but now they actually can issue a tropical storm warning for those high winds when we see it tropical storm Warthat means that the winds could be sustained 39 miles an hour or greater for up to one minute or longer basically you could see tropical storm-force winds in any of these cowsthis runs until further notice from the National Weather Service as far as the rain looks look at the model and then we'll take a regional perspective see where the heavy rain is this iswhat we call the her it's the high-resolution rapid refresh model hrrr the harmonica which updates every hour it doesn't go out very far but it looks it a lot of data soI think it gives us a really clear picture sometimes as to where the heaviest rain might be the her right now he's showing the heavy rain shield lifting never North through Wake County around lunch timeor two from now and we'll see that start to lift off to the North and then notices heavy shower activity continuous your 1-2-3 then we start to see the remnants of the I workingthe southern and western area so the rain shield will die down in some of the Southern areas that heavy rain in lifting Ford Roanoke Rapids North Hamptonuntil 3 or 4 this afternoon then as we go into the evening hours we start to Rapid of the dryer are and you get the remnants of thecancel some of that rain will die down then through the evening hours on the backside of pulling more moisture around the back side so we see that rain as we go through the evening I sent by 10:11those showers are actually done across the triangle and we'll see those showers continuing just right off to the north into the East and working their way outlet's take a regional radar perspective real quick and I want to show you where the showers are at this hour as they press off to the north into the West you can see the eye of of the storenorth of Columbia now and pressing off closer to us we're going to slide this radar up a little bit closer and noticed the Heavy Rain off to the South running right herejust west of Fayetteville in Tahoka more counties this rain shield is going to continue to move on this track and lift across over the next three to five hours so that's why I think I rang likeintensify over the next several hours we're going to continue to watch as we work our way through the afternoon and is more watches warnings or shouldn't happy to pass those along to youI get them

trump officials leave\nso regularly,they don't even get\nbusiness cards anymore.they just write their names\non a little piece of whiteboard.just like, \"yeah, just wipe off\nthe scaramucci and you're good.come on.\"but even though people leave\nall the time,yesterday's news caught\neverybody off guard.tv reporter:\n the surprise shake-up inside the trump administration. u.s. ambassador to the un,\n nikki haley, resigning.tv reporter: a source close\n to haley insisted she's leaving on good terms.for all of you that are\ngonna ask about 2020,no, i am not running for 2020.i can promise you\nwhat i'll be doingis campaigning for this one.i think she's helped make it\na much better position,if you want to know\nthe truth.i think it's become maybe\na more glamorous positionthan it was two years ago.maybe i wonder why,\nbut it is.(mimics trump):\n\"i wonder why, but it is.\"this compliment brought to you\nby #metoo.#metoo, when you just don't know\nwhen to stop.\"(normal voice):\nbut trump's weird comment aside,uh, look at the fun\nthese two are having, right?like, this is different.you never see someone leave\nthe trump white house like this:on good terms with trump,\nscandal-free, smiling.like, usually, it's john kelly\nwho has them in a headlocklike khabib, just trying to\nget them out of the white house.it's like, \"shh. don't fight it.\ngo to sleep. go to sleep.you'll wake up in two days with\na job on fox news. come on.\"in fact,\nhaley's exit was so normalthat it's actually\nbecome suspicious.people are now speculating\nthat haley leftbecause she wants to run\nfor president,uh, that she's in debt and needssome of that sweet\nprivate sector money,or that she wants\nto get out beforea serious scandal comes\nto light.my theory?my theory is she left\nbecause she had ticketsto a star is born \nat the same timeas a security council meeting,and you're not not gonna see\n a star is born,so she just quit.that's what i think happened.but none of that matters.what does matter is that\nour president,hashtag #notmypresident,is sad because his ambassador\nis leaving.and, of course, he's sad,because look at how she\nrepresented america at the un.for too long the human rights\ncouncil has been a protectorof human rights abusers, and\na cesspool of political bias.what we witnessed here today\nin the security councilis an insult.it won't be forgotten.the united states\nwill remember this dayin which it was singled outfor attack\nin the general assembly.and we will remember it\nwhen so many countriescome calling on us\nas they so often do.for those that don't have our\nback, we're taking names.goddamn, nikki haley\ndoes not (bleep) around.like, i can't tell\nif that's c-spanor kill bill: vol 3.it's just like, \"i'm holding\ngrudges and taking names.\"(whoops)although, i will say, i don't\nknow if the united nationsis the best place to say\nyou're taking names'cause everyone is from\na random part of the world.she's like,\n\"all right, i'm taking names.you, what's your name?\"\"haddish harrab.\"\"all right, you know what?\nactually, i'm giving names.\"all right, you're john.i'm not gonna forget\nwhat you did, john.\"and that...(laughter and applause)and that kind of attitude,\nthat kind of attitudeis exactly what trump wanted\nfor america at the un, right?america first,\neverybody else last.and somebody who's not afraidto tell other countries\nwhere they stand.although, i don't know if he\nreally completely understoodwhat haley meant\nby \"taking names.\"and that was really the thing\ni think she did bestat the united nations,\nshe got to know the players.she got to know china,\nrussia, india.she knows everybodyon a very first-name basis,\nand they like her.wow, a first-name basis.everyone, like china.it's almost\nlike trump is impressedthat haley knew\nthe people she worked with.right? \"she knows\neverybody she works with.so impressive.\"it makes me think that trump\ndoesn't know the namesof the people he works with.like, if he wants to talk\nto jared, he just yells,\"bring in that weird guy\nwith the face.no, not him, the other guy.\"so, anyway, a very fond farewellto nikki, um,\nwhatever her name is.i wasn't taking names.the important thing\nis now we want to knowwho is going to replace her.and out of all the people\nwho have been floated,there is one in particular\nthat caught trump's eye.i've heard a lot of names.i've heard ivanka.i've heard,\n\"how good would ivanka be?\"the people that knowknow that ivanka\nwould be dynamite.i think ivanka\nwould be incredible.that doesn't mean i'd...\nyou know, i'd pick herbecause you'd be accused\nof nepotism.even though i'm not surethere's anybody more competent\nin the world.but that's okay.(laughter and groaning)you know, what i enjoy sometimes\nis watching trumphave an entire debate\nagainst himself.(laughter)-like...\n-(cheering and applause)he does...because he does as president\nwhat we all used to do as kids.remember when you'd play\nwith little action figuresand you'd play both roles?and be like, \"i like ivanka.\"\"no, that's nepotism.\"\"screw you.\nshe's best for the job.\"\"i know, but it's not right.\"\"okay, you're right.\nlet's kiss.\"(making kissing sounds)\"ah, i'm pregnant, ah.\"anyway, to her credit,\nfirst lady ivankaquickly took herself\nout of the running for the job,which means trump\nneeds somebody elseto represent him at the u.n.and until they find someone,my suggestion is they just get\na giant, gold handwith its middle finger raised\nin the air.think about it.\nit's tough, it's glamorous,and it truly represents\nhow trump feelsabout the rest of the world.", "ZOxhsrQH7Yw": "judy woodruff: just weeks before his all-but-guaranteed\nreelection, russia's president vladimir putingave his over version of a state of the union\naddress today.as nick schifrin reports, putin used the occasion\nto show off new weapons that he says can defeatu.s. missile defenses and maintain a deadly\nbalance with the united states.nick schifrin: president vladimir putin today\nunveiled a grand vision for his country'sfuture, and what he called the means to achieve\nit, new nuclear weapons.vladimir putin, russian president (through\ntranslator): no one wanted to speak with usconstructively.no one has listened to us.you listen to us now.nick schifrin: he showed off animations of\nweapons he called invincible, a hypersonicmissile apparently capable of crossing continents\nin seconds, and a never-before-acknowledgednuclear powered cruise missile apparently\nthat can slalom between missile defense systemsthat putin considers a long-term threat.it's not clear the weapons even exist.but putin said he wasn't bluffing.vladimir putin (through translator): any use\nof nuclear weapons against russia and itsallies will be perceived as a nuclear attack\non our country.the response will be immediate.nick schifrin: putin's return to cold war\nrhetoric comes one month after the u.s. announcedits own plans to deploy new nuclear weapons,\nand greater willingness to use nuclear weapons.putin said he was responding to american threats.vladimir putin (through translator): the growing\nmilitary strength of russia is a secure guaranteeof peace, because this strength preserves\nand will always preserve a balance of powerin the world.nick schifrin: to no surprise, russian lawmakers\nresponded with praise.they said putin once again made russia a global\nsuperpower.aleksey pushkov, russian politician (through\ntranslator): the theory about russia as aregional superpower with a weak economy disappears\nfrom the american political thinking.nick schifrin: the speech took place just\nover two weeks before the russian elections.putin framed the u.s. as an adversary and\nhimself the only leader strong enough to meetthe challenge.we turn now to richard burt.he was the chief u.s. arms control negotiator\nduring the strategic arms reduction talkswith the soviet union during the reagan administration.he also served as assistant secretary of state\nfor european affairs.he's now at mclarty associates, an international\nbusiness consulting firm.richard burt, thank you very much.richard burt, former u.s. assistant secretary\nfor european affairs: good evening.nick schifrin: is this all about politics,\ndomestic politics, president putin not worriedabout threats to russia, but, in fact, threats\nto his own power?richard burt: well, part of it is certainly\nabout politics.i mean, there is an election in march.nobody's going to beat vladimir putin, but\nputin wants to get a good chunk, 70 percentor more, of the vote, and he can't talk about\nan economy that's rapidly growing.he doesn't have the kind of consumer economy\nthat dominated the early part of the century.people's living standards are actually falling.so, he's playing the great power card.he's saying, i brought russia back, we're\na global superpower, and our technology isfirst-class, it can compete effectively with\nthe united states, and so you can rest easy.nick schifrin: that i am the only one who\ncan take on the united states.so, let's look at it from his perspective\nfor a second.he says, look, you withdraw from the abm treaty,\nthe anti-ballistic missile treat.you're creating missile defenses that can\ncounter our nuclear weapons, and so we haveto counter back.what's wrong with that?richard burt: well, putin is not entirely\nwrong.we did withdraw from the abm treaty in 2002.i personally think that was a mistake, because\nthe russians tend on these kinds of issuesto be paranoid.and the one thing the russians liked about\nthe abm treaty is that it give them the sensethat both sides were vulnerable to annihilation.there was a kind of -- we called it mutual\nassured destruction at the time, and so itmade the soviets feel that -- and the russians\nlater that they were co-equal nuclear powers.they were afraid, when the abm treaty was\nabandoned, that the united states would useits superior technology to be able to engage\nin a potential nuclear first strike, and thatwe could then politically dominate them.and so they have been concerned about that.and that paranoia coupled with, i think, putin's\ndesire to look strong has led to a fairlysignificant nuclear buildup.nick schifrin: so, there is that buildup happening\nin russia.i should say that the united states has also\ntalked about a buildup or modernization ofits nuclear weapons.so, do you fear an arms race right now?do you fear the erosion of arms control?richard burt: well, i fear both of those.we are entering a new arms race, for sure.it reminds me of the 1970s, 1980s.what is interesting is, i don't think americans\nare that focused on this at this point, butit's not only the russians that are modernizing\ntheir forces, with some very capable weaponsthey know how to build and maybe some fictional\nweapons we don't know whether they will buildor not.but the russians are clearly deciding that\nthey want -- see nuclear weapons as an importantelement in their policy.the trump administration is going doing the\nsame.in fact, even under barack obama, the united\nstates decided to engage in a $100 billion-- 100 -- sorry -- $1 trillion-plus nuclear\nbuildup with new missile submarines, new intercontinental-rangeballistic missiles, new strategic bombers.so we're kind of sleepwalking into this new\narms race.i don't think that either side in the near\nterm is going to gain some important advantage,but under these conditions, we could lead\nto a situation where one or the other sidefelt that, in a crisis, a serious disagreement,\nthat the other was going to strike, and thatthat's when, you know, people begin to make\nmistakes.they make miscalculations.and the problem, secondly, is, we don't have\nany arms control negotiations under way.and we have an important treaty, the inf treaty\nsigned in 1987, which could collapse overthe next year because we believe the russians\nare cheating, and they claim we are not followingthe treaty.nick schifrin: quickly, should the u.s. be\nconcerned about this?should americans be concerned about these\nnew weapons or should americans also be concernedabout what you call this sleepwalking into\na conflict?richard burt: i think it's more of the sleepwalking\nproblem.i think what we need to do is find a way to\nget back into a serious conversation withthe russians on controlling nuclear weapons.the longer we wait, the more difficult it\nwill be, not only because both sides willhave better weapons, but with these new technologies\nof the sort that putin talked about today,it's going to be a lot harder to design effective\nagreements to control this new arms race.nick schifrin: richard burt, thank you very\nmuch.richard burt: thank you.", "eLJCHWn2yAs": "you're about to be too ambitious high school

humanist Association for Jefferson senior pastor of First Baptist Church thank you Lordthank you so much I think there are a lot of interesting things about this study notably that seven and a halfmillion Americans left religion in just the past two years and increasing number of people are no longer attending worship services and I think that this is interesting it shows thatnon religion is becoming more tolerant people are essentially a owning their own face recognizing that space is a private matter and if they don't necessarily need a sawfrom a pope or church in order to develop their own spirituality so I think that this is a very interesting study and we'll see more of this in the futuredriving people in people's beliefsI think Lauren what you're saying is that there is a separation now between cultural Christians and genuine Believers the secularizationSociety I think it used to be the people felt like they had to say they believe in God they had to be a Christian they had to go to church to be considered good people that'strue any longer and so what I think is happening is the people who are dropping away where the cultural Christians are people still attending or Genuine Believers and I really think that's anot to have cultural Christians I don't think it's that many people are shifting their belief systems I think people feel free to be honest whether or notGod what did they really identify with the Christian faith and I think that's a good thing not a bad thingthis is a study from the 2014 General Social Survey butebonyline percent of 14% 4% today at night at 57%will another number that's actually gone up is also the number of people who are religiously unaffiliated as you mentioned less people are identifying which traditionI think that's largely has to do with a lot of the anti-lgbt anti-women anti-science rhetoric that's coming out of the pulpit that's coming out of traditional religionyounger people are getting wise they're seeing this becoming a more tolerant Society a more better Society for equality and they support equal right and if traditionalcontinues down this path of negativity in an opposing Spacek human rights were you going to see a lot more people leaving organized religion in droveswell I think I George Barna I had it right when he said a few years ago what you have in America is basically 310 million Americans following 3million different religions I think this do-it-yourself religion for you pick and choose which beliefs you like and don't like I think it's part of a dream that people want to customize theirclose their furniture and they're trying to customize their face but that really doesn't work if you believe in the objective truths of the Bible I mean you cannot customyour faith in more than you can customize the multiplication tables if you believe there are objective truths that are found in the Bible which I do and I think what Maggie is saying isyes people are falling away because of the church's many churches believe in the absolute proof of the Bible but you know Jesus predicted that he said in the endfor unbelievers than Believers thankfully a religion and Truth is not decided by consensus or leipold's it's decided by the absolute truthyou can act like there's not no garbage canbecause I don't like something there must be some kind of objective standard that I'm basing that on so what do you say to I can make my own kind of understandabout religion and Faith what do you say to that are 43 million Americans and more who identify as atheist and human is hoof essentially formed a good MoraAsus system without god without the Bible without organized religion and they're a lot more people who called in spirit Spell spiritual but not religious these are people who haswill to form their own spirituality and there's nothing wrong with that you know we at the American humanist Association support your right to pray support to support the right to exercise their religion as youwhat we don't support is When government gets involved in religion When government endorses one religion over the other that's the problem we have because the separation of church and statewe protect both the majority religion and religious minorities and this is what this country was founded on and this is what we're all aboutwe don't want the church dictating religious beliefs believe in that but you can't have a separation of Faith from truth and here's the real essence of allit's nice flooring that more people are praying but apart from the objective truths found in the Bible how did they know if they're praying to the right God for asking for the right thingwe need the base our faith not on opinion but on the truth is found in God's wordRobert Jeffress thank

missile.\"\"people were told to take cover in basements or in concrete buildings.\"\"could this kind of missile now reach cities on the east coast, possibly new york or d.c.?\"what would happen if north korea launched a nuclear weapon?u.s. officials think north korea has as many as 60 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.and tensions between the two countries have escalated to new levels during the donald trump presidency.remember when trump compared the size of their nuclear buttons?so, how close are we to an actual nuclear war?it\u2019s closer than you might think.the u.s. is reportedly considering a \"bloody nose\" attack on north korea.this could include a manned airstrike or shooting down a missile test launch.basically, a warning shot intended to humiliate north korea.but this warning could be taken as an act of war.jeffrey lewis is an expert on disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation.he thinks the \"bloody nose\" tactic could lead to disaster.the way i think of it is \u2014 the problem with the bloody nose approach is imagine if you saw a guy holding a gun.like if you walk up and punch him in the nose, he might very well shoot you.because he doesn't know that it's only gonna be one punch in the nose.it's also possible that a trump tweet could push north korea over the edge.you could imagine that in the middle of a crisis,where there's a lot of stress and confirmation bias and pressure,a poorly worded tweet might be interpreted as the start of an attack.north korea may also strike first, but that's less likely.at least, that's what former missile launch officer bruce blair thinks.i would be willing to imagine that he would not launch a nuclear weapon at the united statesor our allies unprovoked,because he knows that would be the absolute end of his regime.they are worried that the kim family will suffer the same fate as saddam and his familyor maybe muammar gaddafi.regardless of the trigger, lewis says north korea's attack would be in two phases.in the first phase, north korea would look to wipe out nearby u.s. defenses.they would launch nuclear missiles at u.s. forces based in japan and south korea.when they talk about nuclear weapons, they say the mission of their nuclear weapons is to deter and repel an invasion.the purpose of those nuclear weapons would be to try to destroy the u.s.'s ability to invade them.so destroy the airfields where aircraft may operate out of.to destroy any troops that are massed. to try to damage ports.the u.s. has 30,000 troops based throughout south korea.in the event of an attack,these troops would likely evacuate their bases and help prevent north korean troops from crossing the border.separating north and south korea is the dmz or demilitarized zone.this is the dmz between north and south korea.you can see in the distance over there north korea, just beyond the rock that juts out.tilman ruff was at the dmz with ican \u2014 the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons.they were there to send a message of peace ahead of the winter olympics.he describes what the mood was like on the border.stuff happens quite regularly.  they're shooting across the border.the week before and the week we were there, north korean soldiers tried to defect and crossed the border.one of them was successful, one of them was severely injured by being shot repeatedlyfrom the north korean side.as soon as war erupts, you know there's gonna be millions if not tens of millions of dead in south korea.seoul would be ablaze.over 25 million people live in the seoul metro area.the city itself is just 35 miles from the dmz,and there are over 3,200 bomb shelters that can supposedly withstand an artillery attack...but not necessarily a nuclear or chemical attack.a single 250 kt nuclear bomb over seoul would cause an estimated 783k deaths,and one over tokyo would cause about 697k, according to a study by a group called 38 north.the people of seoul, however, seem unfazed by the constant threat.58 percent of south koreans don't think north korea would actually start a war,according to a 2017 survey by gallup korea.\"ironically, living here makes me feel less threatened against [threats].\u201d\u201c[nuclear weapons] may be used as a means of threat, but i don't think they would actually use it to start a war.\"other potential targets in south korea could include the port of busan,the south korean president's home, the military base yongsan garrison, and camp humphreys.once the nearby us defense is taken out, phase two would be to aim the nukes directly at the united states.this propaganda photo from 2013 shows a map of potential targets.these include pacific command in hawaii; pacom's naval ports in san diego;barksdale air force base in louisiana, which is home to the us air force's global strike command;and washington, d.c.it would take about 30 minutes for a missile to reach the us, and 10-15 to hit japan or south korea.we wouldn't know until it actually exploded whether it was a conventional warhead,a nuclear, or chemical, or biological warhead.so, how would the u.s. respond?blair was a missile launch control officer with the u.s. air force.if kim jong un launched a ballistic missile or more at the united states,we would detect the launch within a minute from satellites in space that have heat sensors.early warning teams in colorado and omaha, nebraska would receive this information as well as reportsfrom ground radar in alaska which could identify the path of a missile within 2 minutes of launch.and those crews in the united states would have about 3 minutes from the time they got the first sensorinformation until they are supposed to assess whether we are under attack.they alert the pentagon of the threat, as well as strategic command,who would initiate an emergency teleconference with the president and his advisors,including the secretary of state, secretary of defense, and the national security advisor.a 4-star general at strategic command would brief the president on the threat and his options.he has probably on average about 6 minutes to deliberate and decide what to do.the war room and the pentagon would then challenge the presidentto authenticate using a special code known as the \"biscuit.\"a launch order would be sent to underground and submarine crews that includes the war plan and special authentication codes.i was one of them. it would have taken me 1 minute to carry out that launch order. it's the length of a tweet.all in all, it could be 20 minutes before missiles are launched at north korea.if north korea launches their missile from a submarine - then the entire process needs to be twice as fast.the us has 44 missile interceptors stationed in california and alaska, but it's not a guaranteed defense.the odds are very low that a single missile could destroy a warhead.so we would have to launch a salvo of our missile interceptorsto have any chance of destroying an incoming north korean nuclear warhead.f-35 fighter jets could also be used to respond to and \"kill\" missiles early in the launch,but we don't yet have this capability in the united states.north korea may also fire off decoys to confuse our defenses, while the real nukes hit their targets.millions of people could die if just one of these nukes hits a major city.while we have an alert system in place, and disaster relief with fema,there's very little someone can do to protect themselves in this situation.all of the bomb shelters and other protection that we had during the cold war have all atrophiedand basically been shut down. so we're starting all over again almost.north korea has no missile defense, so the u.s. could very easily wipe out most of the country with its own nukes.but we are more likely to use non-nuclear options to stop them.we'd win a conventional war. we don't need nuclear weapons.the us would target its nuclear reactors, missile-production facilities, and launching padsfor intercontinental ballistic missiles with stealth aircraft, submarines, and ships.there are estimates of about 200 launchers spread around north korea.the u.s. would also try to take out kim jong un, who would likely be moved to a bunkersoon after a u.s airstrike.with or without nuclear weapons, i don't think kim gets out of this alive.how would other countries respond?japan and south korea both have ground-based missile defense systemsbut those defenses, you know they don't really have a great operational record.china's involvement would likely depend on who strikes first.china would almost certainly come to the defense of north korea if the united states attacks first.it's also indicated to north korea, that if north korea attacks first, it's on its own.in the case of russia, i think it would more or less stand pat.while a nuclear war would be devastating, it's a real possibility.i think that the odds are very significant that in the next 25 years, nuclear weapons will be used.the nobel peace prize winning group ican is working on a treaty to end nuclear proliferation.i think the more promising approach is really a global one.that doesn't say nuclear weapons are okay for me but not for you.you better get rid of yours. but that says nuclear weapons are not okay for everybody.blair's group, global zero, is working towards the same goal.we have to get rid of nuclear weapons. it's the only solution.", "6AwaL8ByduU": "Jonathan landay is the DC National Security correspondent for Reuters a joins me now from Washington so Jonathan what implications

mean, i know us black guys\nlike spending moneyon wheels, but goddamn.now, although trump's solution\nmay be extreme,that doesn't mean\nthat he's wrongabout the underlying issue.because the truth is, china is\ndumping steel into the u.s.and it is hurting\namerican steel companies.so trump is right\nabout the problem,but his solution will cause\neven bigger problems.he's like a doctor whose

challenge, war, so tospeak.you've got the dragon on oneside, the eagle on the other,and i think whether it'sbusiness or military, everythingis going to start falling underthose two.you see companies like facebookon one side doing their deals,in the west, then you seecompanies like alibaba doingdeals in russia and places intheir sphere.from the military side, that'sthe thing nobody talks about,the dirty little secret, it's alittle scary.we had a run-in about a monthago, and you see australia andindia getting nervous, about tospend more on military weaponsthan they have ever spent in thehistory of those nations justbecause they are afraid of whatfalls, they fall under the chinahemisphere.charles: these things didn'thappen overnight.they have been building up forquite a long time.first you create an island, thenmilitarize an island.it was like six years ago, i canrecall the top official in thephilippines asking japan, of allnations, if people understandthe history of philippines andjapan, to re-arm to push backagainst the imperialisticthreats of china.these aren't necessarily newdevelopments.do you think it was time thatsomeone stepped in from our sideto, a, point it out and b, tryto slow it down?&gt;&gt; i think it's so well said,what you said.they did it so wisely, thechinese.very quiet, hidden in the backof the room, acted like therewas a poor little country in thecorner, still getting certainu.n. help as if they were adeveloping country, and i thinkthe world suddenly woke up.those original islands, i don'tknow if you remember way back,when the first sensitivity cameup, the commitment was theywould not be armed.now all of a sudden you see thembeing armed.if you see what that does alongthe south china sea, how closeit is to the philippine boarder,the indonesian border and intoaustralia, that's very importantmilitary strategic positioningthey took.charles: china has claimed thisarea for a long time.even a lot of islands thatalready exist there have beenunder dispute with severalcountries.one of the things apparently isthat they believe there's atremendous amount of oil beneaththe surface there and they wantto own all that.japan, what role should japan --should they ditch their pacifistconstitution and re-arm?&gt;&gt; i think more the fear, if iwas the country to be afraid, iknow it sounds a little crazy,it's more in regard to what youjust said in oil.china is a growing population,tremendous amount of people, andthey are very muchers.the leaders don't just thinkabout themselves, they thinkabout their children and greatgrand clirn.the country that needs to fearthe most is australia.as crazy as it sounds, i couldsee in 100 or 150 years fromtoday, china saying look at thatcountry.they have good land, greatnatural resources,

education\nsegment, making the grade.the obama administration had encouraged schools\nto take a student's race into account to increasediversity.but, under president trump, the administration\nis now urging colleges and universities toadopt standards that are blind to the role\nof race.and it comes as harvard university is facing\na lawsuit over its admission practices forallegedly excluding some asian-american applicants\nin order to make room for students of otherraces.nick anderson covers higher education for\nthe washington post.and marcia coyle covers the supreme court\nfor \"the national law journal.\"and we welcome both of you to the program.nick anderson, i'm going to start with you.so, the administration, trump administration,\nis saying the obama administration went toofar.they are now rescinding seven what are so-called\npolicy guidances that were enacted previously.what does that mean?nick anderson, the washington post: well,\nwhat it means is that the federal government'spronouncements on the supreme court's pronouncements\nhave now changed.so, you have to go back to the supreme court\nhere.over a series of rulings over many years,\nthe supreme court has grappled with race inadmissions and race in schools.and then, after they issue a ruling, from\ntime to time, the federal government willsift through that and try to advise school\nsystems and colleges on what it means forthem.so the obama administration did that over\na period of years from 2011 to 2016, issuedsome statements.and, today, the trump administration said,\nbasically, we're getting rid of those statements,they're not operable anymore.judy woodruff: and, nick anderson, what does\nthat mean for these schools?nick anderson: well, now, that's interesting.if you're a college and you see an incoming\nchange of administration from obama to trump,you probably already knew that there was a\nchange afoot in the way the federal governmentviewed these things.but we haven't had a supreme court ruling\non this for a couple of years now.so the folks i have talked to in higher education\ntoday suggest that we're not going to seean immediate effect of colleges rushing to\nchange their policies.but this action could give some colleges pause\nas they consider the issue.it could say to some colleges, hey, wait a\nminute, you might get challenged on this.remember -- i think you have alluded to this\nalready -- there's a court challenge to harvard'sadmission policy in federal court right now\nin boston.judy woodruff: right.nick anderson: so that's -- i think this action\nby the trump administration adds a dimensionto that debate on affirmative action that\ncolleges are going to have to reckon with.judy woodruff: and let's come to -- well,\nyou raised several points i want to come backto.but, marcia, let's back up further still...marcia coyle, \"the national law journal\":\nok.judy woodruff: ... and look at, what have\nthe courts said, what has the supreme courtsaid over time about taking race into consideration?marcia coyle: ok, the supreme court said,\nin terms of affirmative action, that thereare two interests that justify the use of\nrace, one, to remedy the present effects ofpast discrimination, and, two, to achieve\ndiversity in education, particularly highereducation.now, the court said that, when a university\nuses race, it has to meet the constitution'stoughest review, what we call strict scrutiny.one, it has to show there is that compelling\ninterest, achieve diversity or remedy pastdiscrimination, and it has to be -- the use\nof race has to be narrowly tailored to achievethat interest, it can't go any farther than\nnecessary.and, finally, the court has said that it has\nto show that there are no race-neutral alternativesavailable.the court also has said quotas are illegal,\nunconstitutional.if you're going to use race, it has to be\none of many factors, part of a holistic reviewof a student's application.judy woodruff: so what the obama administration\ndid in interpreting that was leaning in thedirection of incorporating race into decisions,\nand now how the trump administration is interpretingit is different.they're saying, we don't think race should\nbe taken into consideration as much.marcia coyle: i haven't seen yet in writing\nwhat the trump administration is going toissue to universities and school systems.but it's obvious that the obama administration\nprobably would take as broad a view as itcould of the supreme court's ruling, whereas\nthe trump administration, being a conservativeadministration, is going to take a narrower\nview of what it thinks the supreme court said.but the supreme court has been clear.these decisions have been by narrow majorities.the last ruling was in 2016.it was a 4-3 decision.we all know there are nine justices, but it\ncame when justice scalia's seat was stillvacant.justice kagan had to recuse because she had\nbeen involved in that case from texas whenshe was in government.so it was 4-3, and it was justice kennedy\nwho wrote the opinion, and it was really thefirst time he had upheld an affirmative action\nprogram.judy woodruff: and, of course, now we're at\na moment where justice kennedy is leaving.and we're waiting to see who...marcia coyle: a very fragile majority.judy woodruff: and an important moment, another\nimportant moment.so, nick anderson, just to come back to this\nquestion of how are schools to interpret this,you said a minute ago they're likely not to\njump and do something immediately, but totake their time and, what, see what more the\ntrump administration says?nick anderson: yes, it's worth pointing out\nthat the trump administration's language onthis today was very restrained.they didn't come out and say that they want\nto end affirmative action.the statements from secretary of education\nbetsy devos and attorney general jeff sessionswere fairly limited.they were trying to say that the federal government,\nin its previous administration, had oversteppedslightly or in a significant way in its interpretation\nof the supreme court rulings.and they were trying to say that, hey, let's\njust stay with what the judges have said andruled.but they didn't then take the next step, which\nis issue a prescription for what it thinksshould happen.so, i think colleges and universities and\nschool systems as well, because they're partof this, will probably be looking for further\nactions and words from the trump administrationon what it actually wants.and, of course, everybody's eyes are on the\nsupreme court nomination to come.judy woodruff: no question.and, marcia, just quickly back to that harvard\ncase that has been working its way up throughthe courts, where the challenges that harvard\nhas bent over backwards to not -- that, inother words, it hasn't done enough about race,\nthose of different races beyond those whoare asian-american.marcia coyle: the charge is that they have\ndiscriminated against asian-americans in theiradmissions policy.and it's not just harvard.there's a lawsuit as well against the university\nof north carolina.and i think it's important just to -- or interesting\nto note that the man in his organization thatbrought those two lawsuits is the same one\nwho brought the university of texas challengeto the supreme court in 2016.those two cases are at very early stages.they're in federal district court.there probably will be a trial.they have had months of discovery, and it\nwill take a while before they get to the u.s.supreme court.judy woodruff: all of this still...nick anderson: but it's also worth pointing\nout, if i can jump in here, that the harvardcase is likely to draw significant publicity\nbecause it's harvard, and also just to notethat harvard strongly denies these allegations.judy woodruff: nick anderson, marcia coyle,\nwe thank you both.marcia coyle: pleasure, judy.nick anderson: thank you.", "6qReTkWrRXQ": "when we talk about the impact of public\nopinion on foreign policy, it matterswhether we're talking about broad\namerican publicor whether we're talking about subgroups.the overall american public very seldom\ndirectly guides foreign policy.the overall public tends to have two indirect effects. the first is it can constrainthe freedom of maneuver that presidents \nor congress can have.the second is that public opinion tends \nto shape or influencewhat priority policymakers\ngive foreign policy.now when you think of subgroups of the public, lobbies or special interest groups,they can often have a significant impact on\nforeign policy. they can do so becausethey're knowledgeable, they're highly\nmotivated, and often they act in numbers.silicon valley

funding overseasdoes not underwrite abortions.the media have far less impact on\npublic opinion and on foreign policythan you might think. you have\nfirst off the fact that people come tothe news with their own worldview. people\ntend to pick news sourcesthat will give them the take on the world they\nwant to hear. the second thing is,oftentimes we talk about the impact media might have. what we're really talking aboutis the impact of an event.take for example 9/11. clearly that\nengendered wall-to-wall news coverage.but the fact that the american public suddenly embraced a much more aggressive foreign policyhad a lot less to do with how cnn, or msnbc,\nor cbs news covered the storythan the fact that the united states had suffered\na horrific terrorist attack and that3,000 americans had died on a beautiful sunny day.generally speaking the american public\ndoesn't follow foreign policy very carefully.and so while americans may become\nconcerned about an issue overseas,it won't necessarily have a detailed view on exactly what it is that the united states should do.so in that sense the public often doesn't send \nclear signals to policymakers aboutwhat they need to do. \nit's important to keep in mind thatpublic opinion can shift dramatically. that poses\na real challenge to policymakers.the fact that the public is with the president or \nwith congress when a policy is enacteddoesn't mean they will be with the president\nor congress when the policy goes bad.many americans supported the iraq\nwar when it began in 2003. by 2006, 2007the public was much less enthusiastic.\ncontrol of congress changed hands fromrepublicans to democrats in good part \nbecause of dissatisfaction among theamerican public about how the war was going. \nwhat you see is often also thatamerican public opinion can have conflicting\nimpulses, what we might calla double wish. the public wants two things\nbut they're in conflict with each other.an example came in 2014, with the\nobama administration facing the threat ofisis fighters, or the islamic state, in\niraq and syria. many americans werehorrified to see that american hostages\nhad been killed by isis forcesand wanted something done. but by the same token the  american public was pretty clear: it didnot want to see american combat troops\non the ground in iraq, let alone in syria.and so that sense of where

in Del over 65 billionPersian damages most memorable storm for me I was in the location that it hit and it was one of the craziest experiences that I've ever seen in life seeing the streetsflooded was one of the most crazy things it was definitely different than a snow storm or anything like that this is just absolutely unreal this housetraditional Asian this is a word this road stops with this

of the category 5 storms on our list it made landfall in 1969 and left a trail of Devastation from Cuba all the way up to Virginiaif we're near the Cayman Islands as a category three but gained power as it moved up to Mississippi hitting wind speeds of 200 miles an hour at its strongest even aftercall Camille dispersed into a tropical storm it kept on causing damage in the form of flash flooding and mudslides Camille actually ended up being the storm that inspired the current cystranking hurricanes on there Wednesday the darkness the power was out for most areas when the wind the water and the full power of Camille RoarGolf and over the Mississippi Coast this sunrose at Monday morning over at complete Devastation more than a hundred and thirty pdied in the Torrance of water and when Eastbound highway 90 along the Mississippi Coast was destroyed number 6 Gilbert Gilbert was one of the largeclose to ever form in the Atlantic area it was a category 5 that stretch 500 miles across in originated near the islands of Cape Verde on the west coast of AfricaCategory 5 storm in September of 1988 in literally cover the entirety of Jamaica damage in nearly 80% of the islands houses and eventually broke down and becameseries of tornadoes in Texas by making landfall after its I completely Paso to Jamaica two days earlier the minimum Central pressure at landfall inthe mail was estimated to be 900 millibars it was the first Category 5 to make landfall in the Atlantic Basin since hurricane David hit Hispaniola in 1979survive the Labor Day hurricane this Category 5 was consider the strongest storm to ever hit the United States in the 20th century they hit the middle of the Florida Keys and 19th5 in flat its way through Labor Day Celebrations this storm was so bad because it came long before any true hurricane tracking systems came about meaning residenceI had no idea where the storms were going to end up or where they were going to hit as you can imagine this could be pretty devastating number for Katrina when you think hurricanefirst twister that comes to mind will usually be Hurricane Katrina this hurricane cause 108 billion dollars in Damages and claimed nearly 2,000 livesit also cost 400,000 people to move out of New Orleans many of who never returned to their home area the worst thing about Katrina is that it looked like he was dying back outthe 26th of August but when I moved over to the warm water of the gulf is strengthen back up to a category 5 this was so devastating because everyone thought it was dying out and then it cameand hit stronger than ever in did way more damage than anyone expected this is truly one of the most devastating hurricanes that many of us live to talk about today   number 3 the Galveston hurricanebut it was incredibly deadly the storm destroyed areas in Oklahoma Florida Kansas but most of his damage was done in the state of Texas it destroyed almost 3600 homeand a load of buildings that were meant to be considered storm-proof the Galveston hurricane did so much more damage and killed so many in the area of Galveston took these crazy steps to make sure thatwas not repeated they built a huge sea

event that happened over 200 years ago long before the naming system in category system for hurricanes was evenit killed around 22,000 people through almost a week of storms the winds topped well over 200 miles an hour considering strip the bark off of trees and sweptworships from the Revolutionary War it was a crazy storm and it just makes me so thankful that we have the internet today to warn us

the protection is talk and the hope is in the end that the series trade war is over to not to say there won't be some tariffs on a small amount of goods relative to the overalleconomy but in the end I
